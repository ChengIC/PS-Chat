Consumers are taking different paths to purchase, often combining offline and online channels where influencers are a growing force.

The talkability of brands is vital in a fragmented digital media landscape, favouring those with a strong point of view, or purpose, relevant to consumers. The growth of the global workforce and middle class consumers, especially in emerging markets, has resulted in long-term shifts favouring greater convenience and time-saving attributes.'],\n",
