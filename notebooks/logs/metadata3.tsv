Pdf_Chunk_id12: 3Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019Chairman's introductionOur new Chairman reflects on a year of positive value creation, changes to the Board and the steps being taken to accelerate growth in 2020 and beyond.EvaluationSadly, on 31 August 2019, Mary Ma, one of our Non-Executive Directors, passed away after a short illness. Mary was a highly committed and capable Director who put her expertise and experience at the service of Unilever and is greatly missed.Our Board evaluation in 2019 was externally facilitated and the results were discussed at the January 2020 Board meeting. The Board continues to operate in an effective manner overall, and reflecting on the lessons learnt by the Board in the previous year the Board agreed, in particular, in the evaluation discussions to maintain strong focus on organic growth, portfolio evolution, leadership talent, and organisation.Remuneration	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id13: RemunerationDuring 2019 we continued to consult with shareholders on our Remuneration Policy, particularly for the Executive Directors, and set in motion the consultation process for implementing our Remuneration Policy in 2020.Each Board Committee also performed its own self-evaluation, agreeing areas where it could enhance its effectiveness further. These are described within each Committee Report.Nils Andersen ChairmanWith the aim of maintaining the high levels of support from shareholders at the 2019 AGMs for the implementation of our Remuneration Policy, we continued constructive engagement with both our investors and proxy voting agencies on how we intend to evolve the implementation of our Directors’ Remuneration Policy.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id14: Having served on the Board for five years, I am already well aware of Unilever’s reputation as a purpose-driven company, one founded on strong values, wonderful brands and a talented and committed workforce. It was an honour therefore to have been asked to become your Chairman in November 2019 and since then I have continued to work with the Board and the Unilever Leadership team to support the Group's ambitions. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank my predecessor, Marijn Dekkers, for his strong leadership as Chairman and for his support in helping to ensure a seamless transition.Looking ahead	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id15: Looking aheadThe Board fully supports the strategy Unilever is following, including the strategic review of the tea business, and is confident that everything possible is being done to help accelerate top- line growth in 2020. The Board’s confidence also derives from the high calibre of Unilever’s management. We look forward to working with Alan Jope and his team in helping to ensure Unilever remains a long-term, sustainable growth company.Corporate GovernanceRecent revisions of Corporate Governance Codes applicable to Unilever expanded on the long- standing requirements for directors to remain mindful of the duties they have to consider the many stakeholders who have an interest in our business.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id16: During its various visits last year to Unilever’s operations, including in Brazil and the United States, the Board was able to witness first-hand the passion and commitment of Unilever’s hard-working employees. On behalf of the Board, I want to thank all of the 150,000 employees of Unilever for their efforts in 2019, and also acknowledge our appreciation for the continuing support of the Group’s shareholders.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id17: A particular stakeholder focus for the Board during the year was our workforce. As a result, NEDs conducted a number of workforce engagement events to assess employee sentiment. Four face-to-face events were held in Brazil and the UK, allowing for open discussions on issues important to our people. The Board believes that an open, authentic and agile culture at all levels of Unilever fuels personal and business growth. The Board will therefore continuously monitor the culture within the organisation, whether during Board visits, through workforce engagements or by continuing to engage regularly with the Unilever Leadership Executive and other Unilever managers. Further information on our engagement with Unilever’s employees can be found on page 48.2019 PerformanceUnilever delivered another year of positive value creation in 2019, driven by a continuing balance of underlying sales growth, improved profitability and strong cash generation.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id18: Underlying sales growth fell slightly short of the company’s targeted range of 3-5%, which while disappointing, could be explained in part by a significant slowdown in some of Unilever’s high-growth markets. Some of these economic headwinds will continue throughout 2020, but clear plans are in place – which the Board has reviewed – to accelerate the rate of Unilever’s growth in 2020 and beyond.Board composition and successionIn 2019, we took further steps in our commitment to be at the forefront of good governance by cancelling the NV preference shares. We also initiated the termination of the depositary receipt structure for the NV ordinary shares which took effect on 28 June 2019.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id19: The Board appointed Alan Jope to the role of CEO on 1 January 2019 and Alan was duly elected as an Executive Director at the 2019 AGMs. The Board fully endorses the strategy Alan has set out to ensure that Unilever is purpose-led and future-fit, a strategy that at its heart believes sustainable business drives superior performance, creating long-term value for our stakeholders.I was delighted that you also elected Susan Kilsby as a Non-Executive Director at the 2019 AGMs in May, with her appointment taking effect on 1 August 2019.

We’re doing a lot. I’ve already mentioned speed. There are two other areas I would highlight. First, we are putting a heightened level of focus around some proven growth fundamentals, which we are confident will accelerate our top- line performance. These include making our innovations even more impactful; building our presence in faster-growing retail channels, like e-commerce; ensuring that more and more of our brands have a clearly articulated purpose that resonate with consumers; and driving our savings programmes further to help fuel the many growth opportunities we have.confident therefore of restoring underlying sales growth to Unilever’s 3-5% multi-year range.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id22: confident therefore of restoring underlying sales growth to Unilever’s 3-5% multi-year range.What were the highlights for you of 2019? A strong performance in the emerging markets – growing at over 5% – was an undoubted highlight. We also grew across each of our three global Divisions, which was encouraging and reflects the inherent strengths of our brands and our portfolio. Our Home Care Division had a particularly strong year, growing by more than 6%, driven by some great innovations and an intensifying focus around ‘green cleaning’. The performance of our recently acquired prestige beauty brands – which grew double-digit – was also a highlight, further establishing Unilever as an important player in this highly attractive and fast-growing segment of the market.Alan Jope Chief Executive Officer	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id23: Alan Jope Chief Executive OfficerThe second relates to our portfolio. We have made significant changes over recent years, acquiring businesses in new parts of the market and disposing of businesses such as Spreads. The overall effect has been to improve Unilever’s exposure to faster growing markets, those that offer better long-term prospects for value creation. We will continue that process, evaluating our portfolio rigorously against a range of exacting criteria. It is in that context that we have announced a strategic review of our global tea business, which has a large footprint in the slower growing black tea segment and a history of being dilutive to Unilever’s overall growth and margin. We will explore all options, with an open mind and with the intention of sharing the conclusions of the review by the middle of 2020.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id24: How do you see the current state of the world and the impact on Unilever’s markets? There’s no doubt that conditions are challenging right now. Sluggish economies and a high degree of geopolitical uncertainty are inevitably impacting consumer confidence and spending, which in turn is intensifying competition in the retail sector. However, Unilever has now been around for 90 years and so we are very accustomed to operating through downturns and periods of uncertainty like this, and indeed emerging stronger. Moreover, all our competitors – big and small – face the same challenges.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id25: We have set out some very ambitious goals for Unilever. We want, for example, to be a global leader in sustainability; to be the world’s best marketing company; and to be an organisation that stands as a beacon for diversity and inclusion. Seeing Unilever recognised in 2019, therefore, as a leader in multiple external benchmarks, including the GlobeScan Sustainability Leaders Survey (for the ninth consecutive year); the World’s Most Effective Marketing Company; and as recipient of the prestigious Catalyst Award (for the company which has done most to accelerate the progress of women through workplace inclusion), were all special moments – as well as a spur to increase our efforts still further in these important areas.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id26: The key in this environment is to remain relevant to the consumers you serve. For us, that comes down to two things. First, earning trust by operating a responsible, multi-stakeholder business model. And second, harnessing advances in science and technology – and especially digital – in ways that allow us to reach and delight consumers in new and ever more inventive ways. We are firmly focused on both.How are you planning to take forward Unilever’s commitment to social and environmental sustainability? Under the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP) we have developed an enviable reputation for leadership on these issues. We now mean to build on that, not least because many of the challenges the world faces – like the climate crisis or growing inequality – are becoming ever more pressing.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id27: Where do you feel the company could have done better? In markets as dynamic and fast-moving as ours, speed is essential, both in seizing opportunities to meet changing consumer preferences but also in responding when our business is under competitive challenge. While we do this well on many occasions and in many parts of the world, we haven’t yet developed the consistency of response that I am looking for everywhere, and this was apparent in 2019. We made some important organisational changes during the year – including flattening our market structure under a newly created Chief Operating Officer position – which I am confident will help to make Unilever a faster and even more operationally effective business.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id28: The recent outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19) is clearly concerning and we are monitoring developments very closely. The safety and well- being of our people has been the overriding priority. We are also doing all we can to ensure business continuity and our teams are working tirelessly to help mitigate the risks. Inevitably, however, there will be an adverse impact on the business although the extent is not yet clear.We will do this by embedding sustainability in a new purpose-led, future-fit Unilever Compass strategy, and in two principal ways. First, we will continue to use our size and scale to help drive change through our extended value chain. A great example last year was the ambitious commitment we made to address the issue of plastic packaging by halving our use of virgin plastic and by helping to collect and process more plastic packaging than we sell, both by 2025.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id29: As you look back, how do you reflect on Unilever’s business performance in 2019? It was a mixed performance. Our profitability was good with a healthy improvement in underlying operating margin, strong free cash flow delivery of more than €6.1 billion and cash flow from operating activities of €10.6 billion. This is important because our model is predicated on being able to re-invest in the long-term health of the business, while also paying out a competitive annual dividend.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id30: Second, we will make our product brands even more prominent vehicles for driving social and environmental change. Many of our brands already do this, to great effect, but we now intend to make it an integral feature of every brand. We know that it works and that it also helps to drive growth. Last year, our most purposeful brands grew faster than the rest of the portfolio. Unilever’s brands touch the lives of two and a half billion people every day so the opportunity for us to influence behaviour and drive positive change is enormous.As far as our global Divisions are concerned, while it was an excellent year as mentioned for Home Care, our Beauty & Personal Care and Foods & Refreshment Divisions both fell short of expectation – with underlying sales growth at 2.6% and 1.5% respectively – and so this is where we will be looking to accelerate growth most specifically in 2020.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id31: In the area of diversity, we reached an important milestone in 2019 on our journey to become a gender-balanced organisation. Our management population is now made up of just over 50% women. Pleasing as this is, the overall figure masks the fact we haven’t yet made the progress we want at the most senior levels of the company, where women are still under- represented. This is very much a job half-done therefore and something I intend to make a personal priority in 2020.On the flip side, growth is also a key driver of value creation and our underlying sales growth performance fell slightly short of expectations, at 2.9%, which was naturally disappointing. Turnover increased 2.0% to €52.0 billion. While growth was hindered by a marked slowdown in some of Unilever’s high growth markets like South Asia and West Africa, these markets all remain very attractive long-term prospects for us. We are	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id32: I am very proud of all the women and men of Unilever – and the millions more we partner with throughout the value chain – who work so hard every day to bring these commitments to life and who are determined to show that Unilever can remain a force for good in the world.6Strategic ReportUnilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019Unilever Leadership Executive (ULE)Our executive management team is responsible for the day-to-day running of the business and the execution of our strategy, making sure we're purpose-led and future-fit.Graeme Pitkethly Chief Financial OfficerConny Braams Chief Digital and Marketing OfficerMarc Engel Chief Supply Chain OfficerHanneke Faber President, Foods & RefreshmentFabian Garcia President, North AmericaSunny Jain President, Beauty & Personal CarePeter Ter Kulve President, Home CareSanjiv Mehta President, South AsiaLeena Nair Chief HR OfficerNitin Paranjpe Chief Operating OfficerRichard Slater Chief R&D Officer	PDF

Our strategy is constantly evolving to adapt to the trends and forces shaping our markets and impacting our stakeholders.Overview of our industry As a leading global consumer goods company, we’re part of one of the world’s largest, most competitive and fast-moving industries. Yet, these are volatile and uncertain times. According to the World Bank, global growth decelerated markedly in 2019, with continued weakness in global trade and investment affecting both developed and developing and emerging economies. Geopolitical tensions and climate concerns are increasing the uncertainty. Conditions like these create challenges for companies and brands of all types.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id34: Amongst the economic uncertainty, new technologies are changing the landscape of the consumer goods market, bringing opportunities to brands and consumers alike. Consumers are shopping through more diverse channels and smaller local brands are increasingly meeting shoppers’ needs.As the global economy and the channel landscape evolve, we must be agile and responsive to capitalise on the opportunities. And by staying close to consumers and their needs we can ensure our business continues to grow, while having a positive impact on people and the planet.The key trends affecting our stakeholders and our markets are outlined below.Environment and society under stressDigital and technology revolution	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id35: Environment and society under stressDigital and technology revolutionWe’re in the midst of an environmental crisis. Our planet is heating, species are dying out at an unprecedented rate, and our rivers and oceans are filling with plastic. Global heating is placing an increasing strain on food, water and other resources – and rising migration is expected to put new pressures on cities, people, societies and governments.Technology continues to change the fabric of life and business. Enhanced AI, robotics and the internet of things (IoT) are reshaping how people live, work and interact with the world – and with brands. Intelligent technologies are optimising manufacturing and agriculture, connecting global businesses like ours inside and out, and changing how people shop.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id36: As both younger and older generations call for businesses and politicians to do more, only international co-operation and bold action from businesses and brands will start to create the systemic change needed to protect our planet. The cost of inaction far outweighs the cost of action.Digital channels bring opportunities for more targeted marketing, deeper engagement and stronger connections between brands and consumers all over the world. Yet, with access to richer data and more intelligent analytics come risks and concerns around data security and privacy – businesses need to collect and use data in responsible ways.Related principal risks: Climate change, Plastic packaging, Ethical (pages 36 and 39)Related principal risks: Business transformation, Supply chain, Customer, Systems and information (pages 36 to 38)For more on our response see pages 18 to 19.For more on our response see page 15.Living differentlyThe future of work	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id37: For more on our response see page 15.Living differentlyThe future of workSocieties are becoming more diverse and fragmented. We’re seeing, for example, growing splits between generations, socio-economic groups and political affiliations. As people increasingly interact with each other and with businesses online, consumers are making more decisions based on their values. They’re also using both on- and offline channels to find better, more personalised products and services more easily and quickly.The pace of change is affecting not only how people live, but how they work. Businesses of all types are becoming less hierarchical, more automated and more digital. As new roles and ways of working emerge, people increasingly need different skills – and they’re also demanding more flexibility from employers.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id38: Companies that offer more varied types of employment can therefore attract the best people, while being more agile. But alongside flexibility, employees of all ages are increasingly looking for a fair, inclusive and purposeful place to work where they can be themselves and continue to learn.In this new digital media and retail landscape, brands have to be visible, convenient and part of the conversation – taking a stand and action on the issues people care about. The fragmentation of consumer expectations and retail channels creates both challenges and opportunities for companies like Unilever.Related principal risks: Talent, Business transformation (pages 37 to 38)Related principal risks: Brand preference, Economic and political instability, Portfolio management (pages 35 and 38)For more on our response see pages 16 to 17.For more on our response see pages 14 to 15.8Strategic ReportUnilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019Our strategy	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id47: Unilever has a dual-headed structure and is subject to Dutch, UK and US governance requirements as set out in the Governance Report on pages 47 to 78. Under the Dutch requirements, directors are responsible for weighing up the interests of stakeholders, with a view to ensuring long-term value creation and the continuity of the company. Under section 172 of the UK Companies Act 2006 (‘Section 172’) directors must act in the way that they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of their company. In doing so, our Directors must have regard to stakeholders and the other matters set out in Section 172. Pages 12 and 13 comprise our Section 172 statement, which describes how the Directors have had regard to these matters when performing their duty.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id48: In light of our purpose and our strategy to create long-term value as set out on page 9, our Directors take steps to understand the needs and priorities of each stakeholder group and do so via a number of mediums, including by direct engagement or via their delegated committees and forums. The relevance of each stakeholder may change depending on the matter at hand. In line with the Dutch requirements and the UK Companies Act 2006, below we provide a high-level summary of the concerns of our stakeholders and how our Directors engaged with them and had regard to their interests when setting Unilever's strategy and taking decisions concerning the business in 2019.Consumers A good understanding of people's needs is critical to our long-term success.Interests and concernsHow we engaged in 2019Considerations and outcomes	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id49: Interests and concernsHow we engaged in 2019Considerations and outcomesOur Board and ULE members are regularly informed of consumer needs, preferences and concerns – and consider these when making decisions. The agenda for our leadership forum was shaped by a piece of work called the Fundamentals of Growth, based entirely on consumer insights. The findings from consumer surveys help us define and refine the unique purpose of our brands.Through our Consumer Carelines we had over three million interactions through calls, emails, letters, social media and webchats. We also consulted with almost two million consumers this year through regular surveys using partners like Kantar, Nielsen and Ipsos. Unilever Leadership Executive (ULE) members spoke directly to consumers when visiting markets, and our leadership received regular updates and recommendations based on consumer insights.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id50: As the ultimate user of our products, consumers continue to look for quality products that are convenient and good value – and increasingly want more natural ingredients and less packaging and waste. We also know that brands that demonstrate a meaningful purpose create conversations and brand loyalty, particularly among younger generations.For more on consumers see pages 14 to 15.Our people Without talented and committed employees, we could never deliver on our ambitions.Interests and concernsHow we engaged in 2019Considerations and outcomes	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id51: Interests and concernsHow we engaged in 2019Considerations and outcomesIn an October meeting, our Board discussed how best to nurture a more flexible, agile culture. The Board looks at the UniVoice findings each year, and reviewed this year's in November. We also held a series of meetings with a cross-section of employees, where non-executive Board members talk about important topics from the UniVoice survey. In 2019, there were two meetings in the UK and two in Brazil to discuss purpose, talent development and sustainability.Our annual UniVoice survey, available in 48 languages, gives employees at all levels the chance to share views with line managers, colleagues and leadership. In 2019, we had an 82% response rate. Every month we also run smaller pulse surveys to collect real-time insights on key issues.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id52: Our employee surveys tell us that Unilever people tend to have a sense of personal purpose and believe they can live their purpose at work – helping them to go the extra mile. While most employees think we have the right strategy in place to win, they also want to see faster action and decision-making across the business. Our people would also like a continued push towards diversity, particularly at the most senior levels.For more on people see pages 16 to 17 and 48.Society We depend on people and communities all over the world to help source, make and sell our products.Interests and concernsHow we engaged in 2019Considerations and outcomes	PDF

Our USLP Advisory Council – seven independent external specialists in sustainability – also guide and critique the development of our strategy. They met with members of the ULE during the year to share insights on supply chain and human rights.Our leadership engage with NGOs and policymakers to drive system change. Our ULE members, including those on the Board, each own relationships and advocacy around key issues. Our Chief Supply Chain Officer, for example, is part of the World Economic Forum (WEF) community focused on supply chains. This year, as part of our issues prioritisation (materiality) process, we evaluated a range of inputs from stakeholders to understand the most pressing societal issues and where we can make a difference.

Pdf_Chunk_id54: Equality and inclusion, human rights within our operations and supply chain, and health and wellbeing are important issues for our stakeholders. Water scarcity and climate change are also challenges for many people in developing and emerging markets – reflecting the interconnectivity between the environment and society.For more on society see page 18.12Strategic ReportUnilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019Planet We rely on nature for many ingredients and raw materials.Interests and concernsHow we engaged in 2019Considerations and outcomes	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id55: Interests and concernsHow we engaged in 2019Considerations and outcomesThe Board's Corporate Responsibility Committee and USLP Advisory Council (see Society on page 18) discuss key environmental issues. In 2019 the USLP Advisory Council met with members of the ULE to share insights on plastic. Environmental issues form part of our boardroom and ULE discussions and decision-making. Our ambitious new goals around plastic are a good example: our leadership will oversee how these are being delivered, both across our business and through our partnerships. During 2019, there were a number of discussions around the development of our Compass strategy, including our climate goals.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id56: Our Board and ULE members have responsibility for key environmental issues: our CEO works with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the WEF on driving the circular economy, for example. Our ULE members attend meetings, sit on boards, sponsor key workstreams and make sure we have strong and mutually beneficial relationships with our partner organisations. This year, our CEO attended the UN General Assembly's Climate Week in New York. As part of our issues prioritisation (materiality) process, we analysed insights from stakeholders to make sure we're focusing on the most important environmental issues.Awareness of the environmental impact of human activity on the planet is growing. Top concerns include plastic waste, climate change and water scarcity. Loss of biodiversity is also rising up the agenda. We’re seeing growing movements for change around the world, as well as a real desire for businesses to limit their use of plastic and take bold action on climate.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id57: For more on the planet see page 19.Customers We depend on many types of retail partners all around the world to sell our products.Interests and concernsHow we engaged in 2019Considerations and outcomesOur Board and ULE were involved in approving the strategy to digitise small stores and related investments. In a number of markets, such as India and Indonesia, we’ve introduced smartphone apps so that retailers can place product orders directly – and we’re refining these based on user needs. In response to customer feedback, we've introduced retail programmes around the world focused on reducing plastic and food waste. We’re also designing products appropriate for each channel, which will help our customers differentiate themselves.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id58: Our larger retail partners have direct channels into us. We actively manage these relationships through our specialist Customer Development team. In 2019, we discussed a range of sustainability issues with our customers. Through Unilever's digital e-commerce apps, we receive direct feedback from the smaller local stores we partner with to help improve our service to them.In developing and emerging markets, the small retailers we partner with are increasingly seizing the opportunities of e-commerce. And our larger retail partners are looking to become more competitive in online channels, as well as against discount stores offering convenience and very low prices. Retailers want products that are suitable for each sales channel, whether premium or online. They also want more sustainable products that will help them differentiate their offering.For more on customers see page 20.	PDF

After each quarterly market update, our CEO shares feedback with the Board. In 2019, Vittorio Colao, Chair of the Compensation Committee, discussed shareholder concerns around remuneration with the Board and wrote to shareholders explaining subsequent changes to remuneration. These were published in our remuneration report and put to shareholders for voting.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id60: We speak directly to shareholders through investor events, meetings and calls with shareholders, quarterly results broadcasts and conference presentations. Our ULE members attend investor events, and senior leaders and our Board speak directly to shareholders at investor meetings on a broad range of issues. This year, we had focused meetings with shareholders on remuneration, held a sustainability event for investors and issued a webcast on palm oil.As well as ongoing interest in our performance and growth, we've been having conversations with shareholders around our acquisitions and disposals strategy, our corporate structure, capital allocation and our use of plastic and palm oil – reflecting a growing interest in sustainability issues.For more on shareholders see page 21.13Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019Stakeholder review continued	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id62: Understanding people's needs Consumer preferences are constantly changing. To make sure we’re ahead of the curve, we listen for signals that predict the next 'big thing' using data and advanced analytics. In our 30 People Data Centres around the world, we analyse millions of enquiries our Consumer Carelines receive each year and the conversations about our brands online. The insights we get drive the innovation and marketing of our 400+ brands – and, above all, help us give people the products they want.Our new state-of-the art Global Foods Innovation Centre located at Wageningen University in the Netherlands – the leading global agri-food research hub – is helping us to quicken the pace of innovation to improve the health of both people and the planet. Through our partnerships in this ‘Silicon Valley of food’ and around the world, we’re encouraging the wider food chain to become healthier and more sustainable, faster.Caring for society	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id63: Caring for societyOur Beauty & Personal Care brands are taking a stand and acting on social issues all over the world. Take Sunsilk, our haircare brand, which is on a mission to open up possibilities for young women. Its Together We Rock movement is designed to inspire women between 16 and 24 to support each other and feel more able to pursue their dreams. Meanwhile, Dove launched project #ShowUs to shatter beauty stereotypes by building the world’s largest photo library created by women and non-binary people – in partnership with Getty Images, Girlgaze and women everywhere. More than 5,000 images are already in the library, presenting a more inclusive vision of beauty to advertisers and media of all types.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id64: We know that people want healthier and more natural products for themselves and their families, with fewer chemicals. At the same time, concerns around waste, plastic and climate change are growing – consumers are looking for eco-friendly products that are easy to buy and use, yet still effective. Alongside concern for the planet, people are increasingly shopping through multiple channels and, in pursuit of convenience, buying more online.Plant-based foods	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id65: Plant-based foodsIn 2019, we stepped up the availability of our plant-based products including Magnum Vegan, Ben & Jerry’s Dairy-free, Cornetto Vegan, Hellmann’s Vegan Mayonnaise and Sir Kensington’s Vegan range. To help improve biodiversity, Knorr joined forces with the World Wildlife Fund on a global campaign to promote Future 50 Foods, and offered new plant-based recipes to consumers around the world. We also partnered with Burger King to launch the new Rebel Whopper featuring vegan Vegetarian Butcher patties in more than 25 countries across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Thanks in part to these efforts, investor network FAIRR ranked Unilever as among the best prepared companies for the shift towards plant-based proteins.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id66: So we’re continuing to make our products healthier and more sustainable, as we have done for years. This means innovating existing brands, developing new brands and sometimes adding to our portfolio through acquisitions. Here we explain how each of our three Divisions worked to meet consumer needs in 2019.CLEAR introduced a cutting-edge resilience programme, the Resilience Bootcamp, aimed at helping young people overcome social anxiety and unlock their full potential. And Dove Men+Care and Promundo are working together to improve men’s access to and uptake of paternity leave.Beauty & Personal Care We believe in beauty that cares for people, society and our planet.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id67: Beauty & Personal Care We believe in beauty that cares for people, society and our planet.Better for people and the planet This year, we further reduced the salt, sugar and calories in our products, and added even more fortified ingredients (see page 18 for more on this work). We also continued to increase the amount of sustainable ingredients in our brands: as of 2019, 98% of the key vegetables and herbs we buy (around 90% by volume) used in Knorr and other brands were sustainably sourced.Caring for our planetCaring for people	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id68: Caring for our planetCaring for peoplePlastic is a growing concern for consumers, and we’re working hard to make our products use less, better or no plastic. Dove, for example, announced ambitious plans for doing all three across its product range, including moving to 100% recycled bottles by the end of 2019 (see page 44 for more details). All Things Hair successfully piloted refill stations for shampoo and conditioner in the Philippines, and Signal launched our first sustainable bamboo toothbrush. We pioneered a new technology which has made our black TRESemmé and Axe bottles recyclable in most markets. At the World Economic Forum, we announced that six of our brands – Dove, Rexona, Axe, Love Beauty and Planet, REN Skincare and Signal – will begin to use the new global Loop system by TerraCycle, for refilling and reusing containers.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id69: Demand for more natural and holistic approaches to beauty and wellness continues to grow, and so too does our portfolio meeting these needs. Love Beauty and Planet, for example, which first launched in North America in 2018, is now widely available across Europe, Asia and Latin America. Consumers in Europe can now also enjoy Schmidt’s Naturals, a recently acquired US personal care brand. Many of our established brands are also offering more natural products. Lifebuoy now has soap bars with green tea, charcoal and sea minerals, and Signal toothpaste has a new Natural Elements range.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id70: Reducing plastic packaging and food waste continues to be an important priority. We were the first major foods brand to introduce 100% recycled plastic packaging in Hellmann’s jars in Mexico and Bango bottles in Indonesia. Hellmann's in the US has also committed to use recycled plastic materials for all its mayonnaise and mayonnaise plastic dressing containers by 2020. We were the first major ice cream brand to use compostable ice cream tubs in Italy and piloted the first ever ‘wrapperless’ ice cream on Solero multipacks. We also expanded our range of biodegradable teabags and introduced the first 100% recyclable Knorr soup pouches in Turkey.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id71: We’re also creating more effective products using ground-breaking innovations. In 2019, Rexona brought out a Clinical Protection range that’s three times stronger than ordinary antiperspirants and can last for over 96 hours. It's now available in four markets. We expanded our therapeutics offering to consumers in 2019, by acquiring Fluocaril and Parogencyl, well-known oral care brands endorsed by health professionals which are sold primarily in pharmacies in France and Spain.We’re creating products that are better for the planet in other ways. We’ve brought out a new ‘no-rinse’ conditioner in the US, the good stuff, which saves 420 litres of water per bottle. And after certifying Dove as cruelty-free in 2018, animal rights organisation People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has now certified three more of our brands: Love Beauty and Planet, St Ives and Simple.Anytime, anywhere	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id72: Anytime, anywhereWe’re also making our brands more widely available. Our Unilever Food Solutions business – serving professional customers and restaurant operators – continued to grow, serving chefs around the world. IceCreamNow, our instant ice cream delivery service in partnership with a host of online delivery companies, expanded to 35 countries around the world.Our prestige brands continue to meet the growing demand for premium beauty. In 2019, we added two new brands to our portfolio: Garancia, a French derma-cosmetic brand offering 38 premium facial and body skincare products, and Tatcha, a leading prestige skincare brand in North America, which is inspired by Japanese beauty rituals.There’s still much to do as we expand our portfolio of eco-friendly products. But we are taking steps in the right direction.14Strategic ReportUnilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id73: 14Strategic ReportUnilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019Almost half of our Division’s sales are now in emerging markets, where we're working to meet the needs of people at all income levels. In 2019, we saw more and more consumers buying our products in India, China, Indonesia and the Philippines.Home Care We want to make people’s homes a better world, and to make our world a better home.We’re innovating within existing brands, developing new brands and adding to our portfolio through acquisition.Serving the changing consumer	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id74: Serving the changing consumerPeople increasingly want cleaning products that are better for them, their home and the planet – without sacrificing quality or convenience. Across our R&D centres, including our Materials Innovation Factory at the University of Liverpool, we’re working with innovation partners to develop cutting-edge cleaning technologies. Our aim is to create a portfolio of brands that are sustainable by design – fit for a water- scarce, low-carbon world. This means more biodegradable products that are milder on skin while better at cleaning, and that use renewable or recycled ingredients. It also means more eco-friendly products with fewer chemicals, as well as more concentrated products that have a lower carbon footprint due to less water being transported.Every brand a movementOur mission goes beyond providing delicious, healthy and sustainable products – we want our brands to take a stance and real action on the things that really matter.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id75: In 2019, Ben & Jerry’s continued their long tradition of climate activism, joining the youth-led climate strike in September. The brand also launched Justice ReMix’d to fight for criminal justice reform in the US, and continued to campaign for refugee and LGBTQ rights. Lipton Tea launched its global You.Me.Tea.Now campaign to combat loneliness by encouraging more quality connections in people’s daily lives.during the week to help amplify the movement’s message. And Domestos has built on its partnership with Unicef, which helped more than 11 million people (between 2012 and 2019) access better sanitation and hygiene.Designing for channel	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id76: Designing for channelWe’re working to make sure we’re offering our products to consumers in the right places. E-commerce is a key channel so we’re designing our products for home delivery – making sure our packaging fits through a letter box, for example. And we’re expanding our Home Care offerings for growing markets such as DIY stores and mid-sized professional cleaning firms. In Brazil, Omo continued to free people from doing their laundry with its Omo Express pick and wash service.Hellmann’s, with its Real Taste, Less Waste programme, has been running educational campaigns to rescue leftover food from being wasted. In Canada, for example, its Real Food Rescue project is redistributing surplus food to people in need, as well as encouraging consumers to reduce their own food waste and to recycle. And Unilever Food Solutions’ Fair Kitchens programme continued to inspire a new kitchen culture, where staff happiness is just as important as diners’ satisfaction.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id77: Take the relaunch of Omo in Brazil which was one of the highlights of our year. This relaunch included the arrival of our new formulation of Omo Perfect Wash which is more compact, concentrated and effective, leaving no residue on clothes. Bottles now contain 15% recycled plastic, and the smaller box size for the same number of washes means a reduced carbon footprint. In 2019, we also introduced Seventh Generation’s Ultra Concentrated detergent: eight times more concentrated than the original formula, and in a 100% recycled bottle with an exact dose technology in the cap. And we rolled out Love Home and Planet in the US and China: plant-based, independently certified cruelty- free and vegan home care products, including a dry wash spray for clothes that helps minimise energy and water use.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id78: The Cif online engagement across Europe is just one example of how we’re using digital channels and content to reach more people in more places and better understand our consumers. There’s also Cleanipedia, our online resource for cleaning tips, which attracts over 63 million visitors per year. And in Brazil, Comfort sponsored a 13-part TV series encouraging people to get more from their clothes and support more sustainable fashion. By growing our digital marketing capacity, we’re sharing more relevant and meaningful content with consumers, having more conversations with them and using the insights we gather to enhance our activities and brands.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id79: Activities like these don’t just benefit people and the environment, they raise the profile of our brands among consumers. For instance, the markets in which Brooke Bond activated its campaign around mental health and disability grew faster than those where it was not activated in 2019. And in the wake of Knorr’s Future 50 Foods campaign in Belgium, we saw a 10% rise in sales.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id80: In 2019, we rolled out other new packaging formats to help reduce our use of plastic, including refills. Cif ecorefill, for example, is a 10x concentrated cleaner made with 75% less plastic that consumers attach to their Cif spray bottles and dilute at home. This means they can use a single bottle for life. In Chile, people can get refills of Omo detergent and Quix dishwashing liquid from dispensers in electric tricycles that deliver in Santiago neighbourhoods. Quix, which launched in July, uses a world-first technology to create a new cleaning agent that is 100% biodegradable and renewable, while being ultra-mild on hands.Innovations and activities like these are just some examples of how, in all three of our Divisions, we’re meeting changing consumer demands. To see how the divisions performed in the year, see pages 23 to 25.Making our world a better home	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id81: Making our world a better homeOur Home Care brands stepped up their purpose-led activities in 2019. Cif created clean-up campaigns both online and on the streets, leading neighbourhood activities across Italy, Poland, Hungary and Romania. Seventh Generation continued its campaign against climate change by working with the Sierra Club to increase the uptake of renewable energy across US cities. The brand also closed its US office to join the global climate strike in September and donated its advertising airtime15Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019Stakeholder review continuedOur people As the world of work changes, we’re determined to be a company where talented people with purpose can grow both themselves and our business.inclusive employer – giving more options to people with disabilities, family commitments or other time pressures. By moving beyond the typical 9 to 5 employment model, we’re opening up, enhancing and future-proofing Unilever.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id82: The survey also highlighted areas to improve. For example, while our scores on how quickly we respond to changes in the market have improved, half of employees think our competitors are faster. Clearly this is a priority as we develop a growth culture, supported by more agile ways of working. Furthermore, one third of respondents were doubtful that anything would happen as a result of their feedback to the survey. To address this, we have asked the head of each business unit to review their own results and commit to a clear action plan.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id83: The changing world of work There are many facets to today’s evolving workplace. With automation and digital transformation, employees have opportunities to reinvent themselves and learn new skills. People want and need more flexibility from employers – freelance and remote working is on the rise, and jobs for life are increasingly rare. The combination of an ageing population and reduced retirement provision means that people are working for longer. And more and more people of every age want a meaningful job that chimes with their values.Lifelong learningLearning is another critical aspect of people’s fulfilment and Unilever’s long-term commercial success. Ongoing learning is particularly important as we move to more digitally enabled and agile ways of working. We’re aiming to become an organisation where learning is baked into every role – and where relevant and effective training is available to people when they need and want it.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id84: As an external benchmark, we also look at how people rate us on Glassdoor, a jobs and recruitment site. December 2019 figures show that 84% would recommend us to a friend and 93% approve of our CEO. Our rating remains well above the site average.As we make our business fit for growth now and in the future, there’s no more important place to start than with our own people. Put simply, the quality of our people and the quality of our business are one and the same.We’re using digital platforms to give people control of their own learning. In 2019, more than 54,000 employees used Degreed, our online learning platform which holds over two million pieces of content in a variety of formats and in 20 languages. And over 18,000 employees learned new digital skills like agile methods, data analytics and sustainability through our Power Up programme.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id85: Our people have opportunities at townhall meetings and webcasts to ask management about the financial and economic factors affecting our performance. At these regular events, the ULE discusses our quarterly performance and strategy, among other things.The belief that people with purpose thrive is at the heart of our business strategy. So we’re creating a workplace and culture that will make it easier for our employees – all 150,000 of them around the world in factories, R&D labs, offices and tea plantations – to work in ways that suit their individual lives and values. Here we outline how we're adapting to these changes, while ensuring a safe workplace and a future-fit culture.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id86: Digitalisation, automation and the changing world of work affect people in different ways, depending on their roles. We see it as our duty to make sure our people, wherever they work, are equipped for the future. In 2019, for example, we committed to working with the European Works Council on a Framework for the Future of Work. Every employee will be invited to draw up an upskilling, reskilling or an employability plan, so that they are ready to adapt to the changing shape of work in the years ahead. Where we make changes resulting in job losses, we ensure that our people are similarly equipped. For example, we put in place a major programme, including support for setting up small businesses, to ensure the people affected by automation in our tea plantations in Kericho, Kenya could successfully move from job to job.Acting with integrity	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id87: Acting with integrityOne other essential aspect of listening to our employees is giving them a platform for reporting concerns around business integrity, such as anti-bribery and corruption which we simply do not tolerate. We have clearly defined principles around ethics and integrity (our Code Policies) that apply to all of our employees – and we communicate these each year through mandatory online training modules and a business integrity pledge.Reshaping how we work To meet people’s changing needs and continue to attract the best, we're moving beyond traditional employment models and ways of working. In doing so, we need to make sure our people stay safe, healthy and fulfilled at work. In 2019, we’ve taken some big steps forward.More flexible and agile working	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id88: More flexible and agile workingWe do all we can to help people feel comfortable and secure in reporting breaches of business integrity and offer a 24-hour whistleblowing line over the phone or online. In 2019, we received 1,575 reports from whistleblowers. Of these, we closed 1,410 and confirmed 733 as breaches, which led to 413 people leaving the business. Please see page 33 for more on how we manage risks around business integrity.Continuing to be an industry-leading business and employer means moving to faster, smarter ways of working at all levels of our company. So we’re evolving our culture to encourage more agility and accountability.Listening to our people	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id89: Listening to our peopleOur new Flex Experiences platform offers employees the chance to share their talent and experience with people on other teams and in other countries. Live in 20 business areas, so far it has reached over 40,000 people in more than 100 countries and unlocked over 100,000 hours of new career experiences and learning. We’re also changing how we manage performance – encouraging employees to set goals throughout the year to encourage more innovative, entrepreneurial ways of working.To continue to be an attractive employer, we need to understand how our employees experience Unilever every day – and, crucially, to turn these insights into action. So we gather real-time data on topical issues through monthly pulse surveys and other crowdsourcing tools. More than 22,000 people gave feedback in 2019.82%	PDF

This year, 82% of those invited to respond did so, reaching around 90,000 employees, including plantation workers, for the first time. Encouragingly, we saw improvements in our scores across the board. Overall engagement – the headline key metric in the survey – was up 2%, at 77%. Pride in Unilever (87%), our approach to diversity and inclusion (79%), business integrity (81%) and sustainability (77%) stood out as strengths. There was also a 10% increase in the number of people who believe Unilever cares about their wellbeing, to 73%. And 78% of our employees also said we have the right strategy to win.response rate to our 2019 UniVoice survey	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id91: response rate to our 2019 UniVoice surveyIn 2019, we had 30 agile teams on pilot projects around the business. So far, the results have been positive: working in this way not only improves people’s speed and agility but helps them to feel more engaged. So, we’ll be taking what we learn from these pilots to the wider business.Safety at work The safety of our people and those who work with us is paramount. Our Total Recordable Frequency Rate (TRFR) was up in 2019 (1 October 2018 to 30 September 2019) to 0.76 accidents per million hours worked, from 0.69 in 2018.

Pdf_Chunk_id92: 16Strategic ReportUnilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019We also recognise that to evolve our culture, our leaders need a more empowering mindset. So we’ve rolled out new Standards of Leadership which define the expected behaviours of our people in all our countries. In 2019, we put almost 3,000 people through an intensive self- reflective leadership programme. We’re also working on personalised development plans for our next generation of potential ULE members.We’re encouraging gender equality in other ways. For example, we have deeply embedded flexible ways of working across the organisation. Recognising the importance of supporting parents, we have a global paid maternity leave policy of 16 weeks and a global paid paternity leave policy of three weeks.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id93: acquisitions which operate as decentralised business units, as we now have processes in place to collect the data. After a spike in the first six months, when injury rates went up partly due to the inclusion of decentralised business units, the following six months showed substantial incident rate reduction, in line with our year-on- year declining trend. This trend reinforces the confidence that our leadership, programmes and systems will drive further improvement in the years to come. We're committed to achieving our 'vision zero' strategy and will continue to seek improvements that make people safer.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id94: We're committed to gender equality and fairness in the workplace, based on equal pay for equal work and achieving greater gender balance. Pay and overall reward is gender neutral, with any differences between employees in similar jobs reflecting performance and skill. Gender pay gaps can develop where there is a representational imbalance between genders. Our Framework for Fair Compensation has been instrumental in helping us review the average pay differences between genders at both a country level, and at each work level within each country. We continue to improve our gender balance, and relevant gender pay gaps, at various levels and in various countries throughout the business. As part of our Framework's living wage element, we are committed to pay a living wage to all our direct employees. We are already paying at or above a certified living wage in most places and are actively working through the small number of remaining issues which are in areas with complex pay arrangements.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id95: One of the biggest validations of our focus on culture and purpose is the simple fact that people want to work with us. In 52 markets, we’re the number one FMCG graduate employer of choice. And more than eight million people follow us on LinkedIn, making us the most followed FMCG employer.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id96: During the same reporting period, regrettably there were four fatalities at work in Latin America involving two employees and two contractors. Two of these were traffic accidents and two happened in factories. This year we introduced a one-hour stand-down across all of Unilever’s operations globally for fatalities which happen while at work, with a ULE member or country General Manager travelling to the location of the fatality to review the case and learnings. We also held safety events involving all third parties – in manufacturing, logistics and distribution – to ensure stronger implementation and monitoring of safety standards. These efforts run alongside the regular communications and reinforcement of our safety standards at all levels of our company.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id97: Our belief that people with purpose thrive is underpinned by our values set out on page 9. Our Board is responsible for assessing and monitoring these values and our culture. To gain insight, aspects of culture and our values are regularly analysed by the Board using multiple sources, including the results of the UniVoice survey, the main way in which we monitor our culture, business integrity reports (see page 56), interaction with senior management and workforce and health and safety data. At meetings in October and November 2019 respectively, the Board discussed with members of the ULE how best to nurture a culture of flexibility and agility and the results of the UniVoice survey.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id98: Becoming a more attractive workplace to people with disabilities is another priority. We’re focusing on building accessibility and breaking down barriers in this area, as well as on creating an inclusive culture. To show our commitment, we’ve set ourselves a target for people with disabilities to represent 5% of our workforce by 2025.Evolving our culture We’re working to build a more open, authentic and agile culture at all levels of Unilever, to fuel personal and business growth.A workplace for everyoneBecoming a truly diverse and inclusive organisation – one where everyone feels they can bring their whole self to work – is a priority for us. This is not just the right thing to do. It also benefits business, as diversity leads to better innovation and performance.Purpose first	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id99: Purpose firstWe believe that if people feel they can be true to their purpose while working with us, we’ll be able to achieve more together. Through our People with Purpose programme, we’re aiming to work with every employee to help them define their purpose and find a way to reach it in their working life. More than 48,000 people have discovered their purpose since 2015. And it’s making a difference: our UniVoice survey showed that 92% of people who have been through the programme feel they can put more into work because they understand their purpose.We’ve also been working to remove limiting stereotypes from our culture so that employees can be themselves at work. Building on our efforts to break down stereotypes in advertising, our #Unstereotype the workplace initiative has been running for two years. Since 2018, we have been rolling out #Unstereotype bootcamps and customised training to minimise unconscious bias and how to break down stereotypes in 40 countries.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id100: We’re making good progress at management level. Women held 51% of our managerial roles as of December 2019 and our efforts have been recognised – we were featured in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index in 2019. Despite this, there is still work to be done to ensure a balanced representation of women at senior management level and above. Among the various initiatives to address this, we have two targeted programmes to develop our senior women and create a healthy pipeline of talent.Our aim is simple: to be a diverse and inclusive workplace where people with purpose thrive.Fit for the future	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id101: Fit for the futureTo become a more agile organisation, we need to simplify and flatten our internal structures – and to work in more networked ways. We also need to encourage people to make smarter decisions faster, and with customers and consumers front of mind. The tone set by our leaders is important. The ULE is using tools like Yammer to have real – and real-time – conversations with employees. And when we launched our new strategy, we asked our entire organisation for ideas for how to bring the strategy to life. More than 47,000 employees from 80 countries contributed 2,100 ideas, with over 17,000 people voting for their favourites. Three of these ideas have received investment and are now being explored.20182019FemaleMaleGender statisticsFemaleMaleBoard5 (38%)8 (62%)5 (38%)8 (62%)Unilever Leadership Executive (ULE)*474 (33%)8 (67%)(36%)(64%)Senior management (reporting in to ULE)17 (21%)64 (79%)15 (20%)59 (80%)Management	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id104: Creating positive change Our impact on society starts, of course, with our contributions as an employer, taxpayer and buyer of goods and services – amounting to around €34 billion in 2019. But we both need and want to do more. Our Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP) gives us a framework to better the health, wellbeing and livelihoods of millions around the world. Progress against our key 2020 targets is on page 22, and we’re currently developing goals beyond 2020.We’re creating broad change by putting our influence and resources behind projects that support the UN SDGs.

And we continued to focus on the rights of migrant workers, including no payment of recruitment fees, by taking part in multi- stakeholder initiatives such as the Consumer Goods Forum, Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment and Responsible Labour Initiative. We also published a full list of our tea suppliers in 21 countries to help consumers make more informed choices about the products they buy.We can improve people’s lives directly through our products. We can create broader change by putting our influence and resources behind things that matter, often in partnership with others such as projects supporting the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). And our household name brands are changing things for the better.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id106: We believe that plant-based diets are essential for a sustainable food system and will be critical for slowing global heating. So we expanded our range of vegan and vegetarian options in 2019, including the newly acquired Vegetarian Butcher (see page 14 for more). And, through a three-year partnership with the World Wildlife Fund launched in 2019, Knorr is promoting 50 plant-based foods (see page 14).Better health and wellbeing One of our big goals is to help more than one billion people improve their health and wellbeing by 2020. Many of our brands do this directly, while others do it through partnerships working to make it easier for people to live healthy lives.Improving physical and mental healthA fairer world for women	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id107: Improving physical and mental healthA fairer world for womenWe have a responsibility not just to help our employees improve their health and wellbeing (see page 16), but to encourage people everywhere to look after their physical and mental health. Dove’s Self-Esteem Project, for example, has reached over 60 million young people in 142 countries – including 21 million through a specially commissioned cartoon series designed to improve body confidence, which was aired in 12 markets. Lipton Tea launched its new Quality Connections programme in 2019, while Brooke Bond continues its campaign to break stereotypes around mental health and disability. And Clear, our anti-dandruff haircare brand, is tackling social anxiety and building young people’s resilience.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id108: One of the most powerful ways to improve the livelihoods, health and wellbeing of everyone is to create more opportunities for women. So we’re investing in women across our value chain – employees, farmers, small retailers – giving them business opportunities and access to training, finance and technologies.Improving hygiene and sanitationAround 2.3 billion people still have no access to basic sanitation, while 844 million are without safe drinking water. Diarrhoeal diseases are the third leading cause of child mortality globally and around half of the world’s population suffers from untreated tooth decay. We’re working hard to change these numbers. By the end of 2019, we’d reached 1.3 billion people through our activities to encourage behaviours like handwashing with soap and better oral care, and to create better access to clean toilets and safe drinking water.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id109: We put our influence as an advertiser behind the #Unstereotype initiative to encourage a move away from unhelpful portrayals of gender. Many of our brands are pushing for greater gender equality through their brand purpose and partnerships, such as Sunsilk and Girl Rising in Indonesia, Philippines and Argentina, Sunlight and UN Women in Indonesia, and TRESemmé and ICRW in the UK. We’re also continuing to partner with UN Women to improve the safety of women in agriculture, especially on our tea plantations.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id110: Since 2010, for example, Lifebuoy has reached over 1 billion people in its efforts to improve handwashing habits, including 587 million through TV reach. We're working in partnership with organisations such as Gavi to promote vaccination and handwashing, and the Power of Nutrition to give women in rural India advice through their mobile phones about their children’s health, including handwashing. In India, we opened two more Suvidha centres in partnership with HSBC to give people access to clean water, sanitation and laundry facilities bringing the total to three, with two more under development. And, both through its partnership with Unicef and the Cleaner Toilets Brighter Futures programme, Domestos is improving access to toilets for school children (see page 15).Enhancing livelihoods Our activities touch the lives of millions, both directly and indirectly. We have a responsibility to protect their rights and help them live well.More inclusive business	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id111: More inclusive businessWe want to unlock the potential of the millions around the world who help source, make and sell our products – growing our business and theirs. For example, through the CEO Partnership, we have projects in Kenya, India and Pakistan with credit and insurance providers such as Mastercard, AXA and Telenor to deliver digital credit and payment services to small retailers. And we continue to expand our Shakti programme, which gives women in rural communities in countries such as India and Nigeria the opportunity to earn an income by selling our brands.Championing human rights	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id112: Championing human rightsOur Responsible Sourcing Policy sets standards on human and labour rights for our suppliers. In 2019, 70% of our procurement spend was through suppliers meeting these requirements. We have due diligence procedures to identify human rights risks in the supply chain including third-party audits. We aim to support suppliers to find solutions to identified issues, especially where these affect workers’ human and labour rights.Healthier eatingTo further embed a culture of respect and promote human rights, in 2019 we created and began to roll out an internal business and human rights training programme. We also carried out external, independent Human Rights Impact Assessments in Guatemala, Thailand and Turkey. We continued to partner with UN Women, publishing Implementation Guidance for the Global Safety Framework	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id113: Our work also extends to the smallholder farmers we depend on for key crops. For example, in Madagascar, Wall’s is working with NGOs to help families earn a sustainable living from vanilla farming. Across all our smallholder programmes, we've helped more than 793,000 smallholder farmers access initiatives aiming to improve agricultural practices.The world’s food system carries a double burden: almost two billion people are overweight, while 821 million people are malnourished. ‘Big food’ is seen by many as the problem.

Pdf_Chunk_id114: Where water is becoming scarcer, we’re developing products which use less water, while encouraging people to do laundry on shorter cycles.Business needs a healthy world To create the change needed to counter the rapid warming and degradation of the environment, we have to radically overhaul entire systems. Our activities (see pages 10 to 11) impact the environment, mainly through the use of water, energy and land as well as the production of waste and greenhouse gas emissions. Taking action on these issues is not only the right thing to do – it also helps our business as consumers choose brands which align with their values and concerns. Our Environmental Policy outlines our responsibilities to the environment and is, among other things, implemented through the USLP.100%Ending deforestation	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id115: 100%Ending deforestationIn 2010, as a member of the Consumer Goods Forum, we committed to achieving zero net deforestation associated with our four most important deforestation risk commodities by 2020: paper and board, palm oil, beef and soy. For these commodities, we use additional verification on top of our existing sustainability certifications to address the environmental and social issues associated with these particular crops. Specifically, our accelerated activities will include: enhancing our efforts around traceability and transparency using advancements in technology; inclusion of smallholders in our value chain particularly in countries such as Indonesia to help them increase crop productivity and diversify income; and simplifying our approach to sourcing.grid electricity from renewables on 5 continents	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id116: grid electricity from renewables on 5 continentsInnovation with others, plays a big part. For example, we’re working with Ioniqa, a Dutch start-up, to develop a technology that breaks down plastic to make it more recyclable. And we’re investing in solutions – through Circulate Capital’s Ocean Fund, for example, which is working to reduce plastic pollution in South and South East Asia.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id117: Our environmental targets were ground- breaking when we set them in 2010, because they considered the wider value chain, including consumer use. In some areas of the wider value chain, such as lessening consumer waste, we’ve made good progress – in others, such as reducing consumer greenhouse gas and water use, we haven’t done so well. This is disappointing, but we’re using what we’ve learned to refine our strategy. Having launched new goals for plastics in October 2019 (described below), we’re in the process of setting new sustainability goals for beyond 2020. These will both challenge us and, we hope, encourage others to act faster. As we’ve learnt from the last nine years of the USLP, partnerships are key.Protecting nature through sustainable sourcing We use many different raw materials to make our products. Sustainable sourcing and sustainable agriculture are vital to maintaining the supply of these natural resources while also feeding the world's growing population.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id118: Despite our efforts over the past decade, commodity-driven deforestation remains a serious challenge in many parts of the world. We cannot solve deforestation without wholesale transformation of supply chains towards more sustainable models of production. This is why we are working with governments, other businesses, civil society and local communities to tackle the causes of deforestation.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id119: Our Sustainable Agriculture Code lays out standards for the suppliers of our biggest commodities such as palm oil, soy, paper and board – as well as crops such as sugar, tea and vegetables – to farm in ways that sustain the soil, use less water and fertiliser, protect biodiversity and improve people’s livelihoods. In 2010 we set a target to source all our raw materials sustainably. 62% of all agricultural raw materials were sustainably sourced in 2019, compared to 14% in 2010. For the 12 key ingredients that make up around two-thirds of our total volume of agricultural raw materials, 88% were sustainably sourced.Tackling climate change This year we reaffirmed our science-based commitments through the UN’s Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign. We're taking action across our value chain.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id120: Rethinking plastic While plastic does have a role to play in the economy, it does not belong in the environment. Its impact has rightly become a huge concern. With consumer expectations and legislation changing fast, we have to rethink both the design of our products and our business model to build a circular economy – one where we not only use less plastic, but where the plastic we do use can be reused, recycled or composted.Reducing carbon emissions	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id121: Reducing carbon emissionsWe’ve made significant progress in our own operations. Reducing emissions means reducing energy. By the end of 2019 we had reduced energy from our factories by 29% per tonne of production compared to 2008, avoiding costs of around €733 million in the process. We continue to use an internal price on carbon to fund energy projects. See page 40 for more details. Since 2008 we’ve reduced CO2 emissions from energy per tonne of production by 65%. We're also finding ways to replace fossil fuel energy with renewable energy. As of September 2019, 100% of our grid electricity was from renewables across five continents. And 24 manufacturing sites achieved carbon neutral status. We’re now using solar power in 20 countries and are pushing for regulatory changes to move more swiftly away from fossil fuels.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id122: Pushing for system change The radical changes needed can only be made through co-operation – across borders and between boardroom tables. So we’re working closely with organisations such as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to push towards a circular economy. And we’re lending our voice to calls for connected approaches, such as the Nature Based Solutions Manifesto for natural solutions to climate change. We are all in this together, and we still have much to do.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id123: Since 2010, our total waste footprint per consumer use has reduced by 32% – partly through better product design and recycling infrastructure. But we need to do more, and more quickly. So in October 2019, we announced a new ambition to halve the use of virgin plastic in our packaging by 2025 and to collect and process more plastic packaging than we sell by 2025. This will mean exploring new product designs that use more refills, recycled materials, or no plastic at all. And it will mean continuing to invest in infrastructure – expanding our partnerships with waste management companies like Veolia and with household recycling services like Wecyclers in Nigeria.See page 22 for details on our progress against key USLP targets and pages 40 to 45 for more on how we manage risks and opportunities from climate change and plastic packaging.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id124: However, around 65% of our carbon footprint comes from consumers using our products. So halving our total emissions footprint depends on two main things: changes in consumer behaviour and renewable energy becoming more widely available. We’ve made some progress by influencing behaviour through product design, but we need to go faster. So we’re developing our products to use less carbon – introducing more concentrated liquids for example – and joining the RE100 global campaign for better access to renewable energy for all.We’re already making progress. In 2019, nine of our brands registered their interest in participating in a pilot of the TerraCycle Loop refill and reuse scheme in the US and France, with five already launched on the platform. And, we’re bringing more recycled plastic into more of our product packaging, while exploring other options such as glass jars for Knorr soups and sustainable paper for Carte d’Or ice creams.19Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019	PDF

PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id128: The retail world is changing fast. People no longer just shop in one place – they’re using a variety of channels, both online and off, and expect a seamless experience throughout. In developing and emerging markets, we’re seeing a move towards e-commerce and convenience stores – and in the developed world, towards these as well as discount channels. So, it’s becoming even more important to adopt a successful multi-channel approach – offering the right products at the right prices in the right places.Empowering small retailersDigitising the sales value chain so that small retailers can order our products 24/7 is key to building direct relationships, providing growth opportunities for us and our customers.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id129: In Indonesia for example, we've introduced a self-ordering smartphone app and phone ordering option for small stores. In Brazil, we've developed a small retailer e-commerce platform for buying our products, and have 200,000 registered stores so far. And in India, we launched the Shikar app so that traders can place orders without waiting for distributors to visit their stores. We’re also exploring new finance models such as micro-credit partnerships – with Mastercard in Kenya and Telenor in Pakistan – that help smaller retailers access loans to buy stock (see page 18).By relentlessly focusing on customers, consumers and channels, we can make sure our distribution platforms are primed for the evolving shopping habits of people all over the world.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id130: Reinventing retail We’re evolving how we sell to make sure we have the right presence in growing channels such as health & beauty, out of home and e-commerce. We're also partnering with small and larger retailers to create more growth opportunities.Growing e-commerceSelling with purpose We work with our customers to make our brands with purpose more visible – wherever shoppers are. We want to engage consumers on all shopping channels to inspire them to buy, consume and act more sustainably – which also leads to more sales and income for our customers. One way we do this is by bringing our brands to life in stores. We’ve partnered with Walmart in the US and Puregold in the Philippines, for example, to educate people on recycling and plastics reduction to help drive behavioural change through Unilever brands.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id131: The forecast for global e-commerce growth was 20% for 2019. Unilever's e-commerce sales grew 30%, accounting for 6% of our turnover (including sales to consumers both by Unilever and by retailers via their e-commerce platforms). While this pace is fast compared to the market, we need to go faster, partnering with customers who share our aim to grow across e-commerce channels. This year we worked closely with Alibaba, JD.com and other online retailers as part of the one-day Double 11 Chinese shopping gala. Among other things, this involved an interactive on- and offline shopping experience promoting premium products such as Love Home and Planet and Lux botanical shower gels.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id132: Part of selling with purpose is expanding our reach through last-mile and micro distribution models. Programmes like Shakti, through which more than 100,000 women are selling direct to homes and in villages in rural areas of 5 countries, and I’m Wall’s, which has created new livelihoods for thousands of micro- entrepreneurs in over 20 countries, are helping us expand our reach and make a difference to people’s lives. For more on small-scale retailer programmes see page 18.We’re also partnering with large retailers like Tesco, Carrefour and Walmart on omnichannel – across channel – sales models to make sure they reach consumers, however they choose to buy. Our aim is to build a balanced e-commerce model that includes e-commerce retailers, bricks and mortar online sales, and direct-to- consumer businesses.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id133: We’re also making a difference to the planet through a raft of initiatives to reduce and reuse plastics in stores. We’re trialling refill stations with customers in the US and Europe, for example, and are working to expand these programmes.

To help us shape a faster, more responsive business, we’ve reinstated the Chief Operating Officer role and simplified our structures in Europe, South East Asia and Australasia. These actions are all part of building a culture of growth at Unilever: becoming a more agile organisation that makes smarter decisions faster, and with consumers and customers front of mind – see pages 14 and 20 for more.2.9%We delivered underlying sales growth of 2.9%, balanced between price and volume. As we announced in our sales update in December, this means that we fell slightly short of delivering within our multi-year range of 3-5%.underlying sales growth in 2019	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id135: underlying sales growth in 2019Our underlying sales growth was driven by a strong overall performance in our emerging markets, up 5.3% and with a good balance between volume and price. Our businesses in South East Asia, particularly Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam, performed well, as did North Asia. Latin America returned to growth and our Brazilian business also grew well, in an environment which is improving but remains challenging. These gains were, however, offset by difficulties in other emerging markets, including an economic slowdown in South Asia and tough trading conditions in West Africa and the Middle East.That’s why we’re working to ensure that each of our brands has a clear purpose. As well as our brands taking a stand on issues, we’re setting bold goals and taking action on the many environmental and social challenges faced by society, such as plastic and climate change. See page 19 for more.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id136: The transformation is underpinned by technology, which is making a difference at every stage of our operations. It’s helping to improve our sourcing of raw materials, for example we're exploring the potential of AI to calculate ideal harvest times and increase productivity at our tea plantations in Kenya. And it’s creating new efficiencies in our manufacturing operations – at the end of 2019, 31 of our sites were streaming live data using a 'digital twin', which tracks physical conditions and uses machine learning to analyse data and optimise processes, reducing both waste and energy used. We plan to connect another 40 sites in 2020.	PDF

We’re doing this by evolving our portfolio of brands to higher growth segments. This means renovating our existing brands to meet emerging trends, creating new brands (such as Love Home and Planet), and making acquisitions in fast-growing segments like plant-based foods and prestige beauty. Over the last five years we’ve acquired over 30 businesses, including nine in 2019. In January 2020 we announced that we will be conducting a strategic review of our global tea business as we continue to evolve our portfolio to higher growth spaces.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id138: Delivering strong growth continues to challenge us in developed markets, where we see low consumer confidence and a deflationary retail environment. Sales growth in our European business decreased by 0.6%, while in North America we saw modest growth, helped by a good performance in Deodorants and some good momentum in the second half from Dressings.We’re also building digital relationships with our customers and creating better, more cost-effective models of service – for more on this, see page 20. We’re getting even closer to consumers by using advanced analytics to understand trends on social channels and through our Consumer Carelines. The insights we gain are enabling us to be in the right places at the right times with the right products. Digital activities like these make our investments more effective, help us develop more powerful innovation capabilities and ensure we are more responsive to consumer trends.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id139: In our Divisions, Beauty & Personal Care grew 2.6%, led by strong, double-digit growth from Prestige. Deodorants and Skin Care performed well, but growth was weak in Hair Care. It was another good year for Home Care, growing by 6.1% with strong contributions from Fabric Solutions, Fabric Sensations and Home & Hygiene. Foods & Refreshment delivered growth of 1.5%, in a year which saw subdued demand for black tea, and a significant slowdown in the European ice cream market.Many of our recent acquisitions are growing in double digits, including our Prestige portfolio, Seventh Generation and Sir Kensington's. However, some, such as Blueair, haven’t performed as expected in recent years. The aquisition of Horlicks is likely to complete in the first half of 2020.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id140: Our bottom-line performance was good, with underlying operating margin progressing 50 basis points to 19.1%. The improvement was driven by higher gross margins, a result of strong delivery from our 5S savings programme. In addition, free cash flow was up €0.7 billion to €6.1 billion, thanks to an improvement in underlying operating profit.In summary, we are focused on accelerating growth while continuously transforming our organisation to be future-fit. Our purpose- led business model remains key to delivering superior long-term value.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id141: We’re also capitalising on market potential. With 60% of our business in developing and emerging markets, we have an unmatched footprint in high-growth markets. In 2019, 19 of our emerging markets delivered more than €100 million in turnover, with 17 delivering more than €500 million. We’re also building a strong presence in markets of the future, such as Ethiopia and Myanmar. The key to winning in many of these places – and indeed in all our markets – is digitising our route to market and having a strong presence in channels such as e-commerce, as discussed on page 20.

Pdf_Chunk_id142: Purpose-led performance As well as expecting consistent financial returns, shareholders today are increasingly interested in the environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects of business that are so essential to delivering value. Our long-term commitment to ESG is encapsulated in the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan. Our focus and progress on becoming a more sustainable business helped us once again come top of our sector in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index in 2019.Sustainable growth is fuelled by our savings initiatives. We have an everyday commitment to running the business efficiently, using savings to invest in growth areas of the future and in better products and brands. This, in turn, increases our margins.

Pdf_Chunk_id154: Emerging markets performed well with underlying sales growth of 5.3% but developed markets declined by 0.5% mainly as a result of difficult and deflationary conditions in Europe. Overall underlying sales growth was slightly below expectation due to slow down experienced in the last quarter. Price growth decelerated in the fourth quarter as a result of pricing reductions in India and low inflation in Turkey. Africa declined due challenges in West Africa where there were distributor stock resets in Ghana and Nigeria.Argentina’s and Venezuela’s hyperinflationary conditions persisted during 2019 and Zimbabwe also became hyperinflationary during the year. In our calculation of underlying sales growth we exclude price growth in excess of 26% in hyperinflationary economies. See pages 28 to 29 for more details.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id155: Nine business acquisition deals were completed during the year spanning across all Divisions and the global Alsa baking and dessert business was sold in the first half of the year. More details on acquisitions and disposals are in note 21 on pages 134 to 136.Within non-underlying costs, during the year the Group spent €1,159 million (2018: €914 million) on restructuring; both supply chain optimisation projects to improve gross margin and organisational change projects to reduce overheads. Supply chain activities were concentrated in the manufacturing and logistics networks, particularly in Europe and the Americas. Change projects in the markets were focused on transforming the organisation to make it future-fit and digitally enabled, as well as reducing the overhead base in businesses impacted by the spreads disposal.Highlights for the year endedBeauty & Personal CareFoods & RefreshmentHome CareGroup2018 (Restated)(a)2018 (Restated)(a)2018 (Restated)(a)	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id159: Deodorants delivered strong, broad-based growth, supported by double digit growth from Dove. The Rexona Clinical range, with patented anti- perspirant technology to better serve consumer needs, and Dove’s zero aluminium range performed well. Growth in skin cleansing was muted by price reductions as a result of lower commodity prices. Dove’s growth in skin cleansing was supported by microbiome-friendly innovations. Growth was weak in hair care with high competitive intensity in the US and continued pressure from local players in China. Japan and Europe also underperformed. In skin care, Pond’s and Vaseline continued to perform well, with on-trend innovations such as Pond’s Glow Up cream. We expanded into white space markets with our Simple brand, which is now in 30 markets, including Turkey and the Gulf region. Oral care grew slightly and natural variants such as charcoal, aloe and clove drove growth in Smile.	PDF

Carver Korea and Sundial had a more challenging year. We added to our prestige portfolio by acquiring Garancia, a French derma-cosmetic brand, and Tatcha, a modern skincare brand rooted in classical Kyoto rituals.UNDERLYING OPERATING PROFIT increased by €417 million to €4,960 million. Turnover growth and underlying operating margin improvement added €274 million and €143 million respectively. Underlying operating margin improvement of 70bps was driven by efficiencies in brand and marketing investment and overheads from the zero-based budgeting programme. Non-underlying costs of €440 million were slightly higher than last year; most were related to the ongoing restructuring programme. Operating Profit increased by €355 million.Foods & Refreshment	PDF

Growth was supported by plant based and ‘better for you’ offerings, including Magnum vegan and Ben & Jerry’s lighter Moophoria variants. Tea also had price-led growth with declining volume due to subdued consumer demand for black tea in developed markets. Premium black tea, black tea in emerging markets and fruit and herbal variants, including our premium herbal brand Pukka, performed well. In dressings, Hellmann’s grew, with the US business returning to growth in the second half of the year. The Hellmann’s vegan mayonnaise variant is now on shelves in over 20 countries while Sir Kensington’s premium ranges of mayonnaise and salad dressings grew strongly in the US, with the brand now more than doubled in size since the acquisition.

Pdf_Chunk_id164: UNDERLYING OPERATING PROFIT decreased by €194 million to €3,382 million. Turnover and underlying operating margin decline contributed €166 million and €28 million respectively. Underlying operating margin decreased by 20bps as a result of a lower gross margin from weak pricing and higher supply chain costs. The non-underlying costs of €571 million in the year were related to additional restructuring within the business following the spreads disposal in 2018. Operating Profit decreased by €4,476 million which was primarily due to last year’s operating profit including a €4,331 million profit arising from the sale of the spreads business.Home CareTURNOVER grew by 6.9% largely coming from underlying sales growth of 6.1% and a favourable currency impact of 0.4%.

Pdf_Chunk_id165: Home and hygiene performed well, benefitting from products such as Cif surface sprays with natural cleaning ingredients. Hand dish wash saw continued growth momentum, with good performance from Sunlight with recycled packaging, as well as white space launches in Brazil with Brilhante and in China with Omo. Format premiumisation continued to be a growth driver in fabric, with good growth in liquids and capsules. Laundry brand Seventh Generation, based on renewable plant-based ingredients, grew strongly. Fabric performance was supported by ongoing market development driven growth in India, where we also launched premium detergent brand Love & Care. In China we successfully launched Love Home & Planet. Home Care turnover in Africa was lower than expected and declined driven by a reduction in both volume and price.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id166: UNDERLYING OPERATING PROFIT increased by €261 million to €1,605 million. Turnover growth and underlying operating margin improvement added €92 million and €169 million respectively. Underlying operating margin improvement of 150bps was driven by a strong gross margin improvement and lower overheads. Gross margin improved due to strong pricing and positive mix. Non-underlying costs of €228 million primarily related to restructuring programmes. Operating Profit increased by €190 million.25Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019Financial review continued	PDF

We believe this information, along with comparable GAAP measurements, is useful to investors because it provides a basis for measuring our operating performance, and our ability to retire debt and invest in new business opportunities. Our management uses these financial measures, along with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our operating performance and value creation. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP. Wherever appropriate and practical, we provide reconciliations to relevant GAAP measures.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id173: Approximately €1 billion (or 24%) of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents are held in the parent and central finance companies, for maximum flexibility. These companies provide loans to our subsidiaries that are also funded through retained earnings and third party borrowings. We maintain access to global debt markets through an infrastructure of short and long-term debt programmes. We make use of plain vanilla derivatives, such as interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts, to help mitigate risks.

Pdf_Chunk_id174: The remaining €3.2 billion (76%) of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents are held in foreign subsidiaries which repatriate distributable reserves on a regular basis. For most countries, this is done through dividends free of tax. This balance includes €146 million (2018: €154 million, 2017: €206 million) of cash that is held in a few countries where we face cross-border foreign exchange controls and/or other legal restrictions that inhibit our ability to make these balances available in any means for general use by the wider business. The cash will generally be invested or held in the relevant country and, given the other capital resources available to the Group, does not significantly affect the ability of the Group to meet its cash obligations.

We calculate constant currency values by translating both the current and the prior period local currency amounts using the prior year average exchange rates into euro, except for the local currency of entities that operate in hyperinflationary economies. These currencies are translated into euros using the prior year closing exchange rate before the application of IAS 29.We closely monitor all our exposures and counter-party limits. Unilever has committed credit facilities in place for general corporate purposes. The undrawn bilateral committed credit facilities in place on 31 December 2019 were $7,865 million.	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id179: Financial review continuedUnderlying sales growth Underlying Sales Growth (USG) refers to the increase in turnover for the period, excluding any change in turnover resulting from acquisitions, disposals, changes in currency and price growth in excess of 26% in hyperinflationary economies. Inflation of 26% per year compounded over three years is one of the key indicators within IAS 29 to assess whether an economy is deemed to be hyperinflationary. We believe this measure provides valuable additional information on the underlying sales performance of the business and is a key measure used internally. The impact of acquisitions and disposals is excluded from USG for a period of 12 calendar months from the applicable closing date. Turnover from acquired brands that are launched in countries where they were not previously sold is included in USG as such turnover is more attributable to our existing sales and distribution network than the acquisition itself.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id180: Previously, USG was calculated on a different basis as explained on treatment of hyperinflationary economies in underlying sales growth section below. 2018 and 2017 comparative numbers have been restated for the new basis.The reconciliation of USG to changes in the GAAP measure turnover is as follows:Beauty & Personal CareFoods & RefreshmentHome CareTotal Group2019 vs 2018 (%)Turnover growth(a)6.0(4.6)6.92.0Effect of acquisitions0.90.60.30.7Effect of disposals(7.5)(3.0)Effect of currency-related items,2.41.00.41.5of which:Exchange rate changes1.7(3.5)(0.3)(0.7)Extreme price growth in hyperinflationary markets(b)0.64.70.72.2Underlying sales growth(b)2.61.56.12.92018 vs 2017 (%)Turnover growth(a)(0.3)(9.9)(4.2)(5.1)Effect of acquisitions3.90.80.52.0Effect of disposals–(7.2)(0.2)(3.0)Effect of currency-related items,(7.2)(5.8)(8.8)(7.0)of which:	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id182: 2.51.1Underlying sales growth(b)2.92.14.42.8(a)Turnover growth is made up of distinct individual growth components, namely underlying sales, currency impact, acquisitions and disposals. Turnover growth is arrived at by multiplying these individual components on a compounded basis as there is a currency impact on each of the other components. Accordingly, turnover growth is more than just the sum of the individual components. Underlying price growth in excess of 26% per year in hyperinflationary economies has been excluded when calculating the underlying sales growth in the tables above, and an equal and opposite amount is shown as extreme price growth in hyperinflationary markets.(b)28Strategic ReportUnilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id183: (b)28Strategic ReportUnilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019Treatment of hyperinflationary economies in underlying sales growth Previously Underlying Sales Growth (USG) excluded all price growth from countries where the impact of consumer price inflation (CPI) rates had escalated to extreme levels. There were two countries where we had determined extreme levels of CPI existed. Price growth in Venezuela has been excluded from USG since Q4 2017 and price growth in Argentina has been excluded from USG since Q3 2018. This approach was adopted for Argentina in 2018 as it was considered that hyperinflationary conditions would only exist for a short while and thus all price movements would be related to hyperinflation.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id184: Following a review during 2019, we now consider that hyperinflationary conditions are likely to persist for some time and thus price growth will represent both hyperinflationary price growth plus normal pricing actions. As a result, our definition of USG has been updated to include price growth in markets deemed to be hyperinflationary economies, up to a maximum of 26% per year (equivalent to approximately 2% per month compounded). Inflation of 26% per year compounded over three years is one of the key indicators within IAS 29 to assess whether an economy is deemed to be hyperinflationary.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id185: The change is intended to ensure our reporting provides a more realistic representation of underlying performance. Price increases in hyperinflationary economies reflect normal pricing actions that relate to fluctuations in demand, changes in commodity and other operating costs and tactical steps to drive competitiveness, in addition to the exceptional pricing actions taken to respond to hyperinflationary conditions. The new USG definition aims to include these normal pricing actions but excludes the exceptional pricing actions that give rise to the extreme impact that results from hyperinflation.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id186: Also, as a consequence of this change, we are providing a breakdown of the impact of currency-related items on turnover. Whilst previously the devaluation of the currency and all price growth in hyperinflationary economies were grouped under “exchange rate” (now called “currency-related items”), we are now breaking this down between: • exchange rate changes (including the devaluation of hyperinflationary currencies); and • extreme price growth in hyperinflationary economies (i.e. price growth that is not included in underlying price growth).The table below show the impact of this change on USG, UPG and currency-related items on the previously reported numbers:20182017Underlying sales growth and underlying price growth (%)Home CareTotalFoods & Refresh- mentHome CareTotalBeauty & Personal CareFoods & Refresh- mentBeauty & Personal CarePreviously reported Underlying sales growth3.12.04.22.92.92.74.43.1Underlying price growth0.60.71.9	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id188: Underlying price growth Underlying price growth (UPG) is part of USG and means, for the applicable period, the increase in turnover attributable to changes in prices during the period. UPG therefore excludes the impact to USG due to (i) the volume of products sold; and (ii) the composition of products sold during the period. In determining changes in price we exclude the impact of price growth in excess of 26% per year in hyperinflationary economies as explained in USG above.Refer to Note 2 on page 94 for the reconciliation of operating profit to underlying operating profit by Division.

UVG therefore excludes any impact on USG due to changes in prices.Underlying earnings per share (underlying EPS) is calculated as underlying profit attributable to shareholders’ equity divided by the diluted combined average number of share units. In calculating underlying profit attributable to shareholders’ equity, net profit attributable to shareholders’ equity is adjusted to eliminate the post-tax impact of non-underlying items. This measure reflects the underlying earnings for each share unit of the Group.	PDF

Our Corporate Audit function plays a vital role in providing to both management and the Boards an objective and independent review of the effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems throughout Unilever.Organisation The Boards assume overall accountability for the management of risk and for reviewing the effectiveness of Unilever’s risk management and internal control systems.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id212: The Boards have established a clear organisational structure with well defined accountabilities for the principal risks that Unilever faces in the short, medium and long term. This organisational structure and distribution of accountabilities and responsibilities ensure that every country in which we operate has specific resources and processes for risk reviews and risk mitigation. This is supported by the Unilever Leadership Executive, which takes active responsibility for focusing on the principal areas of risk to Unilever. The Boards regularly review these risk areas, including consideration of environmental, social and governance matters, and retain responsibility for determining the nature and extent of the significant risks that Unilever is prepared to take to achieve its strategic objectives.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id213: Boards’ assessment of compliance with the risk management frameworks The Boards, advised by the Committees where appropriate, regularly review the significant risks and decisions that could have a material impact on Unilever. These reviews consider the level of risk that Unilever is prepared to take in pursuit of the business strategy and the effectiveness of the management controls in place to mitigate the risk exposure.The Boards, through the Audit Committee, have reviewed the assessment of risks, internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures in operation within Unilever. They have also considered the effectiveness of any remedial actions taken for the year covered by this Annual Report and Accounts and up to the date of its approval by the Boards.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id214: Foundation and principles Unilever’s approach to doing business is framed by our Purpose and values (see page 9). Our Code of Business Principles sets out the standards of behaviour that we expect all employees to adhere to. Day-to-day responsibility for ensuring these principles are applied throughout Unilever rests with senior management across categories, geographies and functions. A network of Business Integrity Officers and Committees supports the activities necessary to communicate the Code, deliver training, maintain processes and procedures (including support lines) to report and respond to alleged breaches, and to capture and communicate learnings.Details of the activities of the Audit Committee in relation to this can be found in the Report of the Audit Committee on pages 54 to 55.

This review incorporated the activities and key risks of the Group together with the factors likely to affect the Group’s future development, performance, financial position, cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities as described on pages 1 to 32. In addition, we describe in notes 15 to 18 on pages 116 to 132 the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to credit and liquidity risk.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id216: Assessment In order to report on the long-term viability of the Group, the Directors reviewed the overall funding capacity and headroom available to withstand severe events and carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. This assessment also included reviewing and understanding the mitigation factors in respect of each principal risk. The risks and mitigating factors are summarised on pages 35 to 39.The viability assessment has three parts: •First, the Directors considered the period over which they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue to operate and meet its liabilities; Second, they considered the current debt facilities and debt headroom over the viability period, assuming that any debt maturing can be re- financed at commercially acceptable terms; and	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id217: Third, they considered the potential impact of severe but plausible scenarios over this period, including:assessing scenarios for each individual principal risk, for example the termination of our relationships with the three largest global customers; the loss of all material litigation cases; a major IT data breach, reputational damage from not progressing against our plastic packaging commitments, and the lost cost and growth opportunities from not keeping up with technological changes; and assessing scenarios that involve more than one principal risk including the following multi risk scenarios:Multi risk scenarios modelledLevel of severity reviewedLink to principal riskSafe and high-quality products • Brand preference • Supply chainA fine equal to 1% of Group turnover was considered along with damage to our largest brand and disruption to supply chain.

Pdf_Chunk_id218: Contamination issue with one of our products leading to lower sales of products of this brand and the temporary closure of our largest sourcing unit.Major global incident affecting one or more of the Group’s key locations resulting in an outage for a year in a key sourcing unit and significant water shortages in our key developing markets.The complete loss of all of our turnover in our largest geographic market was considered along with destruction of a key sourcing unit and reduced demand for our products that require water.Economic and political instability • Supply chain • Climate changePlastic packaging • Brand preference • CustomerSignificant reputational damage was considered with the impact of losing our three key customers.Lack of progress against our plastic packaging ambitions and the loss of our three largest customers.Findings •	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id219: Findings •Firstly, a three-year period is considered appropriate for this viability assessment because it is the period covered by the strategic plan and it enables a high level of confidence in assessing viability, even in extreme adverse events, due to a number of factors such as: •the Group has considerable financial resources together with established business relationships with many customers and suppliers in countries throughout the world; high cash generation by the Group’s operations and access to the external debt markets; flexibility of cash outflow with respect to significant marketing programmes and capital expenditure projects which usually have a two to three year horizon; and the Group’s diverse product and geographical activities which are impacted by continuously evolving technology and innovation.•	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id220: •Secondly, the Group's debt headroom and funding profile has been assessed: • the Group has a healthy balance of short-term and long-term debt programmes, with repayment profiles ensuring short-term commercial paper maturities do not exceed €0.5 billion in any given week and long-term debt maturities do not exceed €4 billion in any given year; and • the Group has $7.865 billion of committed credit facilities with a maturity of 364 days which are used for backing up our commercial paper programmes.Thirdly, for each of our 14 principal risks, worst case plausible scenarios have been assessed together with multiple risk scenarios. None of thescenarios reviewed, either individually or in aggregate would cause Unilever to cease to be viable.Conclusion On the basis described above, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period of their assessment.34	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id221: 34Strategic ReportUnilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019Principal risks Our business is subject to risks and uncertainties. On the following pages we have identified the risks that we regard as the most relevant to our business. These are the risks that we see as most material to Unilever’s business and performance at this time. There may be other risks that could emerge in the future. Our principal risks include risks that could impact our business in the short-term (i.e. the next two years), medium term (i.e. the next three to ten years) or over the longer term (i.e. beyond ten years).	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id222: The most significant emerging risk is the ongoing outbreak of the Coronavirus (COVID-19). We are monitoring the situation carefully as it evolves to understand the potential impact on our people and our business. Based on the current position there will be a significant impact on the short-term performance of our Chinese business in 2020, in particular our food service business. There may also be impacts in other countries although the extent is not yet clear. We are taking all necessary steps to protect our people and mitigate the risk to our business.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id223: Our principal risks have not fundamentally changed this year. We no longer show Sustainability as a specific standalone risk reflecting the ongoing integration of sustainability into our business and a realisation over the last couple of years that we need to be more granular in explaining what is meant by a sustainability risk and have hence separated out specific sustainability risks, notably Climate Change and Plastic Packaging. This year we are also separating out a risk with respect to Inequality, which was previously included in our overarching Sustainability risk and is now included within our Ethical risk. In addition, we have reassessed our Financial risks and believe our principal risk in this area should focus more on the changing global tax landscape and its impact on our business, and less on the risks related to our pension liabilities as we have made progress in ensuring stability in our pension funding and do not consider the current risk level to be material at this	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id224: stability in our pension funding and do not consider the current risk level to be material at this time.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id225: As well as identifying the most relevant risks for our business we reflect on whether we think the level of risk associated with each of our principal risks is increasing or decreasing. There are three areas where we believe there is an increased level of risk: •	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id226: Plastic Packaging: the pressure to reduce the use of plastic, particularly single-use plastic, continues to gain traction with both our consumers and customers, coupled with the rise of countries considering taxes on plastic packaging; Customers: the retail landscape continues to evolve with a significant proportion of category growth coming from e-commerce and other new channels, so we need to adapt our business models and develop relationships with new customers and make sure our products are appropriate for these channels; and Business Transformation: the pressure to digitise our business to generate efficiencies and to allow our people to focus on driving growth continues; a significant transformation programme is underway and our ability to effectively manage these transitions is a key short-term risk.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id227: We set out below certain mitigating actions that we believe help us to manage these risks. However, we may not be successful in deploying some or all of these mitigating actions. If the circumstances in these risks occur or are not successfully mitigated, our cash flow, operating results, financial position, business and reputation could be materially adversely affected. In addition, risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to vary from those described, which may include forward-looking statements, or could impact on our ability to meet our targets or be detrimental to our profitability or reputation.Nature of riskManagement of riskWe monitor external market trends and collate consumer, customer and shopper insights in order to develop category and brand strategies. We invest in markets and segments where we have built, or are confident that we can build, competitive advantage.Brand preference	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id228: Brand preferenceOur success depends on the value and relevance of our brands and products to consumers around the world and on our ability to innovate and remain competitive.Our brand communication strategies are designed to optimise digital communication opportunities. We develop and customise brand messaging content specifically for each of our chosen communication channels (both traditional and digital) to ensure that our brand messages reach our target consumers. Brand teams are driving social purpose into their brand’s proposition and communicationConsumer tastes, preferences and behaviours are changing more rapidly than ever before. We see a growing trend for consumers preferring brands which both meet their functional needs and have an explicit social purpose.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id229: Technological change is disrupting our traditional brand communication models. Our ability to develop and deploy the right communication, both in terms of messaging content and medium is critical to the continued strength of our brands.Our Research and Development function actively searches for ways in which to translate the trends in consumer preference and taste into new technologies for incorporation into future products.We are dependent on creating innovative products that continue to meet the needs of our consumers and getting these new products to market with speed.Our innovation management process converts category strategies into projects which deliver new products to market. We develop product ideas both in house and with selected partners to enable us to respond to rapidly changing consumer trends with speed.Risk change since last year: No change	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id231: Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019Our risks continuedNature of riskManagement of riskAs part of our sustainability targets we monitor climate change and are responding by ensuring we reduce the carbon intensity of operations and by developing products with a lower carbon footprint or that require less water during consumer use.Climate changeClimate change and governmental actions to reduce such changes may disrupt our operations and/or reduce consumer demand for our products.We aim to minimise our impact on climate change by committing to emission reduction targets and have developed a roadmap to be carbon positive by 2030.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id232: Climate change is occurring around the world which may impact our business in various ways. It could lead to water shortages which would reduce demand for those of our products that require a significant amount of water during consumer use. It could also lead to an increase in raw material and packaging prices or reduced availability. Governments may take action to reduce climate change such as the introduction of a carbon tax or zero net deforestation requirements which could impact our business through higher costs or reduced flexibility of operations.We monitor trends in raw material availability and pricing due to short term weather impacts, and proactively reformulate our products where appropriate to ensure continued availability of input materials.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id233: We monitor governmental developments around actions to combat climate change and take proactive action to minimise the impact on our operations. We also advocate for changes to public policy frameworks that will enable accelerated decarbonisation, in line with the upper level of ambition of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.Increased frequency of extreme weather (storms and floods) could cause increased incidence of disruption to our manufacturing and distribution network. Climate change could result therefore in making products less affordable or less available for our consumers resulting in reduced growth and profitability.Risk change since last year: No changeWe are committed to reducing the amount of post-consumer plastic packaging waste going to landfill. We have committed to ensuring 100% of our plastic packaging is reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025.Plastic packaging	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id234: Plastic packagingWe use a significant amount of plastic to package our products. A reduction in the amount of virgin plastic we use, the use of recycled plastic and an increase in the recyclability of our packaging are critical to our future success.We aim to halve our use of virgin plastic by both reducing usage and accelerating use of recycled plastic. This requires us to redesign products by considering modular packaging, design for disassembly and reassembly, wider use of refills, recycling and using post-consumer recycled materials in innovative ways. We are working on innovative solutions through new business models.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id235: Both consumer and customer responses to the environmental impact of plastic waste and emerging regulation by governments to tax or ban the use of certain plastics requires us to find solutions to reduce the amount of plastic we use; increase recycling post-consumer use; and to source recycled plastic for use in our packaging. We are also dependent on the work of our industry partners to create and improve recycling infrastructures throughout the world.We aim to collect and process more plastic packaging than we sell, enabled through driving systematic change in circular thinking at an industry level working with partners such as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. We are also working with governments, industry partners, suppliers and consumers to raise awareness and find solutions to improve the recycling infrastructure for plastics. We are helping consumers to understand disposal methods and supporting collection schemes and facilities.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id236: Not only is there a risk around finding appropriate replacement materials, due to high demand the cost of recycled plastic or other alternative packaging materials could significantly increase in the foreseeable future and this could impact our business performance. We could also be exposed to higher costs as a result of taxes or fines if we are unable to comply with plastic regulations which would again impact our profitability and reputation.Risk change since last year: IncreaseWe build and maintain trading relationships across a broad spectrum of channels ranging from centrally managed multinational customers through to small traders accessed via distributors in many developing countries. We identify changing shopper habits and build relationships with new customers, such as those serving the e-commerce channel.CustomerSuccessful customer relationships are vital to our business and continued growth.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id237: CustomerSuccessful customer relationships are vital to our business and continued growth.Maintaining strong relationships with our existing customers and building relationships with new customers who have built new technology-enabled business models to serve changing shopper habits are necessary to ensure our brands are well presented to our consumers and available for purchase at all times.We develop joint business plans with our key customers that include detailed investment plans and customer service objectives and we regularly monitor progress.We have developed capabilities for customer sales and outlet design which enable us to find new ways to improve customer performance and enhance our customer relationships. We invest in technology to optimise order and stock management processes for our distributive trade customers.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id238: The strength of our customer relationships also affects our ability to obtain pricing and competitive trade terms.

Pdf_Chunk_id257: Risk change since last year: No change39Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019Our risks continuedWe regularly carry out climate-related risk assessments at site level, supplier-level, as well as innovation-project level. Management of climate related risks is distributed throughout the organisation depending on where the risk resides. For example, climate risks in relation to commodities in the supply chain are managed by our procurement team who are responsible for buying commodities.In focus: Climate change Unilever advocates for policies that advance the goal of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change to limit the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C, and ideally no more than 1.5°C, above pre- industrial levels by the end of the century. We believe this means achieving a net zero emissions world by 2050.Understanding financial impact: scenario analysis	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id258: Understanding financial impact: scenario analysisTo achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, we recognise the importance of disclosing climate-related risks and opportunities in line with the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). This will enable market forces to drive efficient allocation of capital and support the transition to a low-carbon economy.This section explains how scenario analysis helps us to understand the potential impact of climate change on our business in 2030 to inform our strategy and financial planning.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id259: To further understand the impact that climate change could have on Unilever’s business in the future, we performed a high-level assessment of the impact of 2°C and 4°C global warming scenarios. The 2°C and 4°C scenarios are constructed on the basis that average global temperatures will have increased by 2°C and 4°C in the year 2100. Unilever believes the world should seek to limit global temperatures to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. However, in line with guidance we have modelled scenarios based on 2°C and 4°C scenarios.In this Annual Report and Accounts, we continue to integrate climate- related disclosures throughout the Strategic Report narrative. In recognition of the growing significance, and our increasing understanding of the impacts of climate change on our business, we have also summarised in this section the key risks and opportunities arising from climate change, including the potential impacts on our business.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id260: Governance The Boards take overall accountability for the management of all risks and opportunities, including climate change (see page 33). Our Chief Executive and Executive Board member, Alan Jope, is ultimately responsible for oversight of our climate change agenda. The Boards are supported by the ULE. During 2019, the USLP Steering Team was fully integrated into the main ULE agenda to reflect the integration of sustainability into our business strategy. The ULE meet monthly to discuss key strategic matters. During 2019, there were a number of agenda items on topics related to climate change including our climate goals.We focused the assessment on our business in 2030 assuming that we have the same business activities as we do today. While we understand that policy risk and physical impact can happen simultaneously, we made the following simplifying assumptions: •	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id261: In the 2°C scenario, we assumed that in the period to 2030 society acts rapidly to limit greenhouse gas emissions and puts in place measures to restrain deforestation and discourage emissions (for example implementing carbon pricing at $75-$100 per tonne, taken from the International Energy Agency’s 450 scenario). We have assumed that there will be no significant impact to our business from the physical ramifications of climate change by 2030 – i.e. from greater scarcity of water or increased impact of severe weather events. The scenario assesses the impact on our business from regulatory changes. In the 4°C scenario, we assumed climate policy is less ambitious and emissions remain high so the physical manifestations of climate change are increasingly apparent by 2030. Given this we have not included impacts from regulatory restrictions but focus on those resulting from the physical impacts.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id262: A number of other specialist governance groups are in place to support our climate agenda, including: •Energy Board: Drives delivery of our carbon positive ambition at corporate and country level and leads strategic partnerships and policy on renewables. Chaired by our Chief Supply Chain Officer, Marc Engel. Sustainable Sourcing Steering Group: Supports our strategy focusing on long-term, sustainable access to our key crops. Chaired by our Chief Procurement Officer, David Ingram. Water Board: Steers our strategy and targets on water, focusing on driving water-smart innovations for business growth. Chaired by our Home Care Category President, Peter Ter Kulve.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id263: We identified the material impacts on Unilever’s business arising from each of these scenarios based on existing internal and external data. The impacts were assessed without considering any actions that Unilever might take to mitigate or adapt to the adverse impacts or to introduce new products which might offer new sources of revenue as consumers adjust to the new circumstances.

Pdf_Chunk_id264: Remuneration linked to achievement of sustainability and climate change targets is a key part of our governance. For management employees – up to and including the ULE – incentives include fixed pay, a bonus as a percentage of fixed pay and a long-term management co-investment plan (MCIP) linked to financial and sustainability performance. The Sustainability Progress Index accounts for 25% of the total MCIP award and includes consideration of progress against our manufacturing scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas and sustainable palm oil targets, which among others, underpin our climate strategy. See pages 60 to 77 for more on MCIP including the role of the Board’s Remuneration Committee and Corporate Responsibility Committee in determining the MCIP award each year.The main impacts of the 2°C scenario were as follows: •	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id265: The main impacts of the 2°C scenario were as follows: •Carbon pricing is introduced in key countries and hence there are increases in both manufacturing costs and the costs of raw materials such as dairy ingredients and the metals used in packaging. Zero net deforestation requirements are introduced and a shift to sustainable agriculture e.g. Climate Smart Agriculture, puts pressure on agricultural production, raising the price of certain raw materials.The main impacts of the 4°C scenario were as follows: •Chronic and acute water stress reduces agricultural productivity in some regions, raising prices of raw materials. Increased frequency of extreme weather (storms and floods) causes increased incidence of disruption to our manufacturing and distribution networks. Temperature increase and extreme weather events reduce economic activity, GDP growth and hence sales levels fall.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id266: Strategy and risk management Climate change has been identified as a principal risk to Unilever which has the potential to impact our business in the short, medium and long term. The physical risks and opportinities that we face from climate change include extreme weather and water scarcity. The transition risks and opportunities include changing consumer preferences and future policy and regulation.The process for assessing and identifying climate-related risks is the same for all principal risks and is described on page 36. For each of our principal risks we have a risk management framework detailing the controls we have in place, who is responsible for managing both the overall risk and the individual controls mitigating it. We monitor risks throughout the year to identify changes in the risk profile.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id267: Our analysis shows that, without action, both scenarios present financial risks to Unilever by 2030, predominantly due to increased costs. However, while there are financial risks which would need to be managed, we would not have to materially change our business model. The most significant impacts of both scenarios are on our supply chain where costs of raw materials and packaging rise, due to carbon pricing and rapid shift to40Strategic ReportUnilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019smaller than the anticipated significant effects of acreage growth and improvements in farming technologies. Associated price reductions are expected in most scenarios over a 30-year horizon. The overall risk to Unilever of average, direct climate change impacts is therefore relatively low.sustainable agriculture in a 2°C scenario and due to chronic water stress and extreme weather in a 4°C scenario. The impacts on sales and our own manufacturing operations are relatively small.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id268: We have therefore developed and piloted an approach to assess the impact of climate change on our key commodities, including soy and black tea.However, there are some specific risks to Unilever. At an individual country level, there is a risk of a reduction in yields in 2030 in a 2°C scenario in Kenya, and in 2050 in a 4°C scenario in Argentina. The plateauing of yields in Kenya is a specific risk to Unilever if additional acreage is not made available as a result of government or land use change policies, which consequently limits future production. There are also some small price risks in Kenya and Argentina.Assessing the impact on soybean oilWe selected soy based on its importance to Unilever (large purchased volume), it being a high-profile crop in the countries where it is grown and the availability of good historical price data and suitable climate models.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id269: We developed a methodology which combined forecasting future yields and quantifying the impact on commodity prices of soybean oil. The forecasting of future yields was performed using a combination of crop specific and climate change models. The price model used a range of supply and demand drivers to determine the impact of changes in yield from direct risks of climate change, isolating other factors such as acreage and technology on price. Three modelling steps were performed: •Our analysis also implied that the impact from climate change on average yields may be less significant than the impact of extreme weather events and man-made factors, which can affect black tea production and prices respectively. These events can result in much larger than average impacts in individual years, but the frequency and nature of these events cannot be accurately predicted.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id270: The quality of black tea, excluded from our analysis, was found to have a larger impact on price than yields, especially in India. The expected water scarcity and temperature stress in 2°C and 4°C scenarios, could change the average black tea quality, leading to potential future price risks. The lack of appropriate substitutes further increases the risk profile surrounding tea. While the overall risk to Unilever of direct climate change impacts on black tea is relatively low, the country specific risks and the uncertainty of impacts from other significant factors will require further analysis and individual action plans to be defined/refined for each country.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id271: Yield estimation: We analysed multiple crop and climate models to provide a forecast range of expected yields in key growing regions. Price relationship: An econometric model was developed, based on an analysis of the soybean oil market and historical trends, to estimate the impact of climate-induced yield changes on future prices. This model considered the importance of co-products e.g. soybean meal, substitution potential e.g. with sunflower oil and industrial uses of soybean oil, as well as the impact of yield on price. Impact estimation: Future yields and price impacts were then translated into an estimated financial exposure from climate change for our business, using our forecast procurement volumes.Managing physical risks and opportunities	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id272: Managing physical risks and opportunitiesOur scenarios assess the potential impact of climate change over the long term on key commodities. However, we also face physical climate change risks and opportunities in our supply chain and direct operations over the short and medium term – notably from the effects of extreme weather and water scarcity.Our pilot analysis showed that soybean yields may increase over the 2030 and 2050-time horizon and that subsequent lower prices may then lead to small potential reductions in our procurement spend on soy. While the results may indicate a low financial risk to our business, we need to consider a wider range of risk factors when determining our strategic response. Indirect risks from climate change, such as extreme weather events or external policy response and adaptation could also have an impact but were not included in our modelling. Furthermore, these pilot results are specific to soy and can’t be applied to other crops.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id273: Extreme weatherUnilever’s business depends on purchasing materials, efficient and uninterrupted manufacturing and the timely distribution of products to our customers. Both the increased frequency of extreme weather events and changes to weather systems could cause disruption across our value chain. While the frequency and extent of extreme weather is hard to predict, we monitor changing weather patterns on a short-term basis and take action to mitigate any negative affects.Assessing the impact on black tea	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id274: Assessing the impact on black teaWe are the world’s biggest tea company and buy around 10% of the world’s black tea. We worked with the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research to develop suitable crop models for black tea yield predictions. Our modelling considers a range of scenarios and impacts on crop yield and this drives variability in outcomes that we observe. This enabled us to assess the direct risks from climate change on black tea by following the same approach used for soy in 2018. We similarly sought to isolate the impact of yield changes on prices from other important factors such as acreage, farming technology, tea quality, extreme weather events and man-made factors such as elections, unrest and governmental policy.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id275: Operating costs and commodity prices can be impacted by extreme weather caused by climate change. To mitigate this we have contingency plans to secure alternative key material supplies at short notice, for example during extreme weather events, to transfer or share production between manufacturing sites and to use substitute materials in our product formulations and recipes. Commodity price risk is actively managed through forward buying of traded commodities and other hedging mechanisms. Trends, including weather patterns, are monitored and modelled regularly and integrated into our forecasting process. Our Sustainable Agriculture Code promotes the principles of Climate Smart Agriculture to our suppliers and includes practices that sustainably increase the productivity and resilience to extreme weather.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id276: However, unlike soy, the black tea market is highly fragmented, lacks liquidity and does not operate as one global market. This required us to conduct an analysis of individual countries to identify the risks Unilever is exposed to in each. We selected our four key black tea sourcing countries for the analysis: Argentina, India, Kenya and Turkey.Extreme weather also has the potential to impact Unilever operations and assets, including our inventory of products as well as owned property which could suffer physical damage or loss. We use sustainable building standards such as BREEAM or LEED for new developments to future proof our assets and reduce obsolescence. For instance, our newly opened Foods Innovation Centre in the Netherlands attained BREEAM outstanding, meaning it met stringent climate adaptation measures.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id277: The different market dynamics in each country presented separate challenges and risks. Each country has also been affected by different evolutions in acreage growth and farming technologies, which at an overall level, have influenced black tea production and resulted in an overall, global increase in tea yields over time.Our analysis of the direct effects of climate change showed that yields for each country and scenario range from a predicted decrease to a predicted increase, indicating some exposure to risk. However, on average, yields are predicted to increase. This average increase in yields, however, is much41Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019Our risks continuedintroduction of carbon taxes or zero net deforestation policies.Water stress	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id278: introduction of carbon taxes or zero net deforestation policies.Water stressHousehold water scarcity caused by climate change is another physical risk, which is exacerbated by population growth and urbanisation. During periods of drought consumers may reduce their use of certain products including laundry detergents, shampoos and conditioners, and toilet cleaners as they are unable to access water to use them or experience declining water quality which limits their enjoyment and/or efficacy. While the overall impact of water stress on our sales, from both policy and physical impacts, was not found to be significant in our scenario analysis at a global level within the 2030 time horizon evaluated, the impacts we see in the short term tend to be more local.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id279: Our business is heavily dependent on forests for key commodities. We’re one of the largest end-users of palm oil in the FMCG sector and we also buy other commodities associated with a risk of deforestation, including soy and paper and board. In 2010, together with other organisations in our industry, we committed to achieving zero net deforestation associated with four commodities (palm oil, soy, paper and board and beef) by 2020. Despite our efforts over the past decade, commodity-driven deforestation remains a serious challenge in many parts of the world. We’re taking a number of steps to eliminate deforestation from agricultural commodity supply chains. Firstly, we are transforming our own supply chains by making sure the palm oil, soy, paper and board, and tea we buy is both traceable and certified as sustainable. Secondly, we are working with governments and other partners to ensure that deforestation gets the political attention and financial resources it needs. In particular,	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id280: that deforestation gets the political attention and financial resources it needs. In particular, we are focused on helping reduce deforestation in key regions of South-East Asia, South America, and West and Central Africa. We’re also using our networks and relationships to help tropical forest countries access large-scale, performance-based payments for emissions reductions from forests.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id281: We are investing in new products and formulations that work just as well with less water, poor quality water or no water, with a particular focus on household cleaning, skin cleansing, oral and hair care. Many of our Beauty & Personal Care and Home Care products now have fast-rinse technology as standard, using less water or low temperature washing. We have also developed dry shampoos (e.g. TRESemmé) and ‘leave in’ conditioners (e.g. Dove).Managing transition risks and opportunities	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id282: We consider the impact of possible future mandatory carbon pricing in key countries which could result in increases in both manufacturing costs and the costs of raw materials such as ingredients and packaging. To mitigate this, in 2016, we implemented an internal price on carbon as part of the business case appraisal for large capital expenditure projects. This did not change behaviour as we expected since energy costs – and therefore carbon costs – were largely immaterial to the capital costs over the assessed period. As a result we took the decision to end this shadow carbon pricing approach and instead applied a novel approach of internally taxing the notional capital expenditure budgets of our three divisions based on the emissions from the prior year, to raise a clean-tech fund. So far, over €120 million has been allocated to this fund for energy, waste and water saving projects. Since January 2018 our internal price of carbon for this fund has been €40 per tonne.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id283: The transition to a low-carbon economy presents a number of risks, but also opportunities for Unilever over the short and medium term – notably from changing consumer preferences and future policy and regulation.Changing consumer preferencesUnilever’s growth and profitability is determined by our portfolio, geographical and channel presence and how these evolve over time in response to consumer demand. Failure to pre-empt or respond to changing consumer preferences could impact our growth.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id284: We're developing our product portfolio to offer products with a lower carbon footprint. For example, we have been shifting our Home Care laundry portfolio towards concentrated liquid laundry detergent formats for a number of years. Brands such as Persil, Omo and Surf Small & Mighty and Seventh Generation’s EasyDose enable people to wash their clothes at lower temperatures, reducing GHG emissions by up to 50% per load. Concentrated detergents also mean that we can fit doses for more washes into smaller bottles, reducing the water used at manufacturing facilities and hence the emissions associated with transportation and packaging.Our climate targets are one of the ways we mitigate the risk of future policy and regulation. In 2019, we announced that our factories, offices, R&D facilities, data centres, warehouses and distribution centres across five continents are now powered by 100% renewable grid electricity.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id285: The next portfolio shift, in line with changing consumer preference, will future proof our Home Care brands to ensure they continue to deliver superior cleaning, while being kinder to the environment. This will include, for example, using a new generation of ingredients which deliver superior performance at lower dosage resulting in GHG savings.Metrics and targets We have been measuring and reporting on our energy and water consumption and carbon emissions since 1995. The USLP includes a number of stretching targets which relate to climate risks and opportunities across our value chain. Performance against key targets can be found on page 22 with commentary on page 18 and 19. Our website contains detailed commentary on our USLP targets as well as actions we are taking to achieve them. Two of our GHG reduction targets are recognised as science-based: •	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id286: Consumers in a number of markets are increasingly adopting plant- based diets which have a lower GHG footprint than meat-based diets. According to our Lifecycle Analysis, our GHG emissions from animal-based agriculture (including fats and proteins), is relatively low, accounting for around 7.5% of our Foods & Refreshment GHG footprint, and 2.5% of Unilever’s total GHG footprint. A recent FAIRR report also noted that Unilever had the lowest exposure to GHG emissions from animal agriculture in the sector. It also identified us as the best prepared food company for the plant-based boom. We have a range of vegan and vegetarian variants and continue to actively promote vegetarian and vegan recipes (see page 14).	PDF

Reduce scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 100% from our own operations by 2030 (this is aligned with our ambition to become carbon positive in our manufacturing, where the majority of our scope 1 and 2 emissions occur).	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id288: To capitalise on the future revenue opportunities, our M&A strategy aims to acquire new businesses which serve specific consumer segments such as sustainability conscious consumers. A number of our recent acquisitions, including Pukka Herbs, Sundial, Mae Terra, Seventh Generation, and OLLY Nutrition, are recognised as B Corps – meaning they have met stringent environmental and social criteria as laid out in the B Corp impact assessment. For example, Seventh Generation advocates for renewable energy and is taking action to decarbonise its own business and Pukka Herbs has its own science-based zero carbon goal.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id289: We’ve created a detailed plan to annually assess the feasibility for Unilever to reach our target to halve the greenhouse gas impact of our products across the lifecycle by 2030, taking both external transitions towards a low-carbon economy as well as the latest available data and assumptions about our GHG footprint into account. See page 22 for our latest progress against these targets and page 19 for commentary. Our ability to meet our climate-related targets partly depends on changes in the energy markets worldwide, such as the rate of installation of renewable electricity in many countries and the availability of purchase power agreements. We are also dependent on countries implementing their Paris commitments and inFuture policy and regulationCurrent and emerging laws and regulations have the potential to impact financial performance as governments may take action, such as the42Strategic ReportUnilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id299: Our risks continuedChanging consumer preferencesIn focus: Plastic packagingThere has been a significant rise in consumer concern regarding plastic packaging over the last few years. Concern is not universal and takes on different dimensions in different countries depending on the media coverage and government focus. A recent study by Kantar/GfK found that plastic waste is the second biggest concern globally among consumers, behind climate change. The survey also found it was a top concern among consumers in Eastern Europe and Asia and second in Western Europe.As a packaged goods company, we are a significant user of plastic packaging for our products. We believe that plastic has a place in the economy but not in the environment. We want to help build a circular economy in which we not only use less plastic, but also ensure the plastic we do use can be reused, recycled or composted.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id300: In this Annual Report and Accounts, we have integrated plastic packaging disclosures throughout the Strategic Report narrative. We have also summarised the key risks and opportunities arising from plastic packaging in this section of the report. We hope that this will raise the standard of reporting on plastic packaging across the industry.More recycling on its own will not solve the issue of plastic packaging in the environment. It is therefore imperative to address plastic waste at the source. There is a risk that some consumers will stop buying our products if we do not find ways to reduce our use of plastic packaging and increase the amount that is recyclable or reusable. Equally, for companies that are proactive, there is a significant opportunity to attract consumers who want to buy consumer goods products in packaging solutions which use less virgin plastic and are recyclable or reusable.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id301: Governance The Boards take overall accountability for the management of all risks and opportunities, including plastic packaging (see page 33). Our Chief Executive and Executive Board member, Alan Jope, is ultimately responsible for oversight of our plastic packaging agenda. He is supported by the ULE, including our Chief R&D Officer, Richard Slater, who is responsible for driving the plastic strategy, and Divisional Presidents who lead the plastics agenda within their respective Divisions. The ULE meet monthly to discuss key strategic matters, including plastic packaging. In July, the ULE reviewed the key issues on plastics, renewed our commitment to our existing goals and fully endorsed our new 2025 plastic targets.Our strategy to pre-empt changing consumer preferences is organised around our 'less, better, no plastic' framework.Less plastic	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id302: Less plasticWe know consumers expect us, first and foremost, to reduce our reliance on plastic packaging. That’s why we committed to reducing our use of virgin plastic in our packaging by 50% by 2025, to no more than 350,000 tonnes. We plan to deliver this firstly by eliminating over 100,000 tonnes of plastic from our packaging by accelerating multiple-use packs and reusable, refillable, and no plastic product innovations. We will deliver the remainder by increasing our use of recycled materials, helping keep plastic in the economy and out of the environment by giving plastic a value to ensure it can be collected and processed (see also ‘collecting plastic’ below).	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id303: The Sustainable Packaging Committee steers our strategy and targets on sustainable packaging by understanding stakeholder concerns and bringing in new technologies and partnerships. The Committee meets four times a year, is chaired by our Chief R&D Officer, Richard Slater, and includes senior leaders and plastic packaging specialists from across our Divisions, Markets and Functions.As part of this commitment we aim to avoid unintended consequences when we introduce alternative materials, ensuring limited impact on the environment, including on GHG emissions. We apply a lifecycle assessment approach to inform decisions when shifting to alternative materials in our reuse models.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id304: Plastic packaging is a key part of our sustainability programme. Remuneration linked to achievement of sustainability targets is a key part of our governance. For management employees – up to and including the ULE – incentives include fixed pay, a bonus as a percentage of fixed pay and a long-term management co-investment plan (MCIP) linked to financial and sustainability performance. The Sustainability Progress Index accounts for 25% of the total MCIP award and next year will include consideration of progress against one of our plastic targets to increase the recycled plastic content in our packaging. See pages 60 to 77 for more on MCIP including the role of the Board’s Remuneration Committee and Corporate Responsibility Committee in determining the MCIP award each year.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id305: We are exploring new ways of packaging and delivering products - including concentrates, such as our new Cif Eco-refill which eliminates 75% of plastic, and new refill stations for shampoo and laundry detergent rolled out across shops, universities and mobile vending in South East Asia. See page 14 to 15 and 19 for more examples of brands that are reducing plastic. Our reduction commitment also encompasses sachets. We are investing in alternative solutions to plastic sachets including paper-based alternatives and refills, such as our Philippines Hair Refillery and our Love Beauty and Planet Refillery in Vietnam.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id306: Strategy and risk management Plastic has been identified as a principal risk for the company which has the potential to impact our business in the short, medium and long term. The process for assessing and identifying plastic packaging risk is the same for all principal risks and is described on page 36. For each of our principal risks we have a risk management framework detailing the controls we have in place and who is responsible for managing both the overall risk and the individual controls mitigating it. We monitor risks throughout the year to identify changes in the risk profile.Better plasticOur original 2017 target to ensure 100% of our packaging is reusable, recyclable, compostable plastic by 2025, as well as our recycled plastic commitment, both remain a very important part of our approach to ‘better plastic’ and we are already making progress on this commitment across our Divisions and brands.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id307: Our use of recycled plastic has increased significantly in the last year as we have stepped up our purchasing of recycled plastic – and we expect this to increase in the coming years. Dove, for instance has recently committed to launch new 100% recycled plastic bottles where technically feasible, in North America and Europe by the end of 2019, across all ranges (Dove, Dove Men+Care, and Baby Dove). It is also exploring alternative materials and new packaging formats.We have taken decisive action to mitigate the risks and capitalise on the opportunities. In 2017, we were the first company in our industry to commit to ensuring that 100% of our plastic packaging is reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. In 2019, we announced two new goals to complement the 2017 commitment:Halve our use of virgin plastic, by reducing our absolute use of plastic packaging by more than 100,000 tonnes and accelerating use of recycled plastic.

Pdf_Chunk_id308: Better plastic has led to pioneering innovations such as the new detectable pigment being used by Axe (Lynx) and TRESemmé , which makes black plastic recyclable in most markets, as it can now be seen and sorted by recycling plant scanners. In 2018 we announced a partnership with start-up company Ioniqa and the largest global producer of PET resin Indorama Ventures to pioneer a new technology which converts PET waste back into virgin grade material for use in food packaging.Help collect and process more plastic packaging than we sell.We also restated our commitment to use at least 25% recycled plastic in our packaging by 2025.44Strategic ReportUnilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019Human rights risksNo plastic	PDF

We have already brought to the market innovations including shampoo bars, refillable toothpaste tablets, cardboard deodorant sticks and bamboo toothbrushes. Our partnership with TerraCycle on the Loop platform is exploring new models of delivering and collecting reusable products from consumers’ homes. Premium skincare brand REN Clean Skincare, Hellmann’s, Love Beauty and Planet, Love Home and Planet and Seventh Generation are trialling new reusable packaging made from aluminium and glass. Dove, Rexona and AXE will also test a premium, refillable deodorant stick called minim™ made from stainless steel.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id310: We are aware that there are potential human rights issues in emerging markets which do not have formalised waste management infrastructure. Informal waste collection (waste pickers) and recycling is a common way to earn an income and a livelihood. Our responsible sourcing policy contains clear guidance on twelve fundamental principles such as the protection of workers’ health and safety, employing a permitted workforce (age/freedom of movement etc) and fair wages. We have refused to work with waste management companies based on a lack of assurances on human rights, child labour and working conditions. We are developing global standards on ‘formalising’ the informal sector and legitimising waste pickers.Policy and regulatory risksMetrics and targets We have been measuring and reporting on our manufacturing waste since 1995. Our website contains detailed commentary on our plastic packaging targets as well as actions we are taking to achieve them.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id311: There is a growing focus from governments on plastic and the potential for regulatory and tax measures in a number of markets where we operate. In the EU for example, member countries have agreed to the Plastics Strategy set out by the European Commission, which requires that all plastic waste will be recyclable by 2030. This incorporates the Single-Use Plastics Directive which includes measures to reduce consumption of food containers and beverage cups made of plastic and specific marking and labelling of certain products. The actions described under ‘market risks and opportunities’ are in part a mitigation strategy to pre-empt plastic restrictions and regulation.To date we still lack the complete data set necessary to accurately measure our actual performance in accordance with our basis of preparation which outlines our measurement methodology, but are on track to build the required robust and granular reporting systems during 2020.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id312: Policy developments in the area of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) are also likely to become more common. We are supportive of EPR regulations which reflect the unique waste management requirements of the market. In developing markets, we are working with governments and other stakeholders to support the development of collection and reprocessing infrastructure before a formal EPR system is designed and adopted. In addition, we support the implementation of comprehensive waste management legislation to build a more effective and efficient waste infrastructure.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id313: For the reporting period July 2018 to June 2019, we have accurate data for around 70% of our sales volume from products with plastic packaging and through extrapolation estimate that more than 50% of our plastic packaging was reusable, recyclable or compostable. In 2019 we estimate around 5% (35,000 tonnes) of our total plastic footprint was recycled plastic – a significant increase on our 2018 use of recycled plastic. Our use of recycled plastic will continue to increase in the coming years as we work towards our 25% by 2025 goal. We intend to provide an interim update next year.Improving waste infrastructureFurther waste and packaging disclosures	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id314: Improving waste infrastructureFurther waste and packaging disclosuresOver the last five years Unilever has collaborated with many partners to collect plastic packaging, including the United Nations Development Programme, to help segregate, collect and recycle packaging across India. In addition, we have helped to establish almost 3,000 waste banks in Indonesia, offering more than 400,000 people the opportunity to recycle their waste. In Brazil, we have a long-running partnership with retailer Grupo Pão de Açúcar to help collect waste through drop-off stations.This Annual Report and Accounts contains additional disclosures on our plastic packaging risks and opportunities: • Governance: page 44 • Strategy: pages 19 and 44 to 45 • Risk management: pages 44 to 45 • Metrics and targets: pages 22 and 45	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id315: In 2019 we introduced a new target to invest and partner to collect and process more plastic packaging than we sell by 2025 to mitigate any potential future regulatory costs associated with EPR. This requires us to help collect and process around 600,000 tonnes of plastic annually by 2025. We will deliver this commitment by: investing and partnering with others to improve waste management infrastructure; purchasing and using recycled plastics in our packaging; and participating in extended producer responsibility schemes where we directly pay for the collection of our packaging.Our website contains disclosures on our waste and packaging targets.www.unilever.com/sustainable-living/our-sustainable-living- report-hubAdvocacy to drive systems change	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id316: Advocacy to drive systems changeAcross all our plastic targets, we need to continue our advocacy, partnerships and policy approach to drive system-wide change. For example, it is important that we unlock regulatory barriers for PCR use. It is also imperative that there is a favourable policy environment to support sustainable financing for collection as well as financial incentives for the right behaviours.45Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019Non-financial information statement	PDF

At any adjourned general meeting, present affected class holders may establish a quorum.Unilever’s structure Since its formation in 1930, the Unilever Group has operated as nearly as practicable as a single economic entity. This is achieved by special provisions in the Articles of Association of NV and PLC, together with a series of agreements between NV and PLC which are together known as the Foundation Agreements (described below). These agreements enable Unilever to achieve unity of management, operations, shareholders’ rights, purpose and mission and can be found on our website.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id320: Articles of association NV’s Articles of Association contain, among other things, the objects clause, which sets out the scope of activities that NV is authorised to undertake. They are drafted to give a wide scope and provide that the primary objectives are: to carry on business as a holding company, to manage any companies in which it has an interest and to operate and carry into effect the Equalisation Agreement. At the 2010 PLC AGM, the shareholders agreed that the objects clause be removed from PLC’s Articles of Association so that there are no restrictions on its objects.On 31 December 2019, no 6% or 7% cumulativepreference shares were issued.Indemnification	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id321: On 31 December 2019, no 6% or 7% cumulativepreference shares were issued.IndemnificationThe terms of NV Directors’ indemnification are provided for in NV’s Articles of Association. The power to indemnify PLC Directors is provided for in PLC’s Articles of Association and deeds of indemnity have been agreed with all PLC Directors. Third-party directors’ and officers’ liability insurance was in place for all Unilever Directors throughout 2019 and is currently in force.The Equalisation Agreement makes the economic position of the shareholders of NV and PLC, as far as possible, the same as if they held shares in a single company and also regulates the mutual rights of the shareholders of NV and PLC. Under this agreement, NV and PLC must adopt the same financial periods and accounting policies.Allocation of profits	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id322: Allocation of profitsUnder NV’s Articles of Association, available profits after reserves have been provided for by virtue of law, the Equalisation Agreement or deemed necessary by the Board, are paid first at a rate of 6% and 7% per year to 6% and 7% cumulative preference shareholders respectively when such shares are issued*. The remaining profits are paid to ordinary shareholders in proportion to the nominal value of their holdings.In addition, PLC provides indemnities (including, where applicable, a qualifying pension scheme indemnity provision) to the Directors of three subsidiaries each of which acts, or acted as trustee of a Unilever UK pension fund. Appropriate trustee liability insurance is also in place.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id323: The Deed of Mutual Covenants provides that NV and PLC and their respective subsidiary companies shall co-operate in every way for the purpose of maintaining a common operating policy. They shall exchange all relevant information about their respective businesses – the intention being to create and maintain a common operating platform for the Unilever Group throughout the world. This Deed also contains provisions for the allocation of assets within the Unilever Group.The Governance of Unilever A comprehensive description of Unilever's corporate governance arrangements, including further details on the structure of the Unilever Group, is set out in 'The Governance of Unilever'. It further details the roles and responsibilities of the Chairman, Senior Independent Director/ Vice-Chairman, CEO, CFO and other corporate officers and how our Boards effectively operate as one board, govern themselves and delegate their authorities.

The surplus is paid by way of a dividend on the ordinary shares.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id325: Under the Agreement for Mutual Guarantees of Borrowing between NV and PLC, each company will, if asked by the other, guarantee the borrowings of the other and the other’s subsidiaries. These arrangements are used, as a matter of financial policy, for certain significant borrowings. They enable lenders to rely on our combined financial strength. The borrowing power of NV is not limited by NV’s Articles of Association. PLC Directors have the power to borrow on behalf of PLC up to three times the PLC proportion of the adjusted capital and reserves of the Unilever Group, as defined in PLC’s Articles of Association, without the approval of shareholders (by way of an ordinary resolution).Lapse of distributions	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id326: Lapse of distributionsThe right to cash and the proceeds of share distributions by NV lapses five and 20 years, respectively, after the first day the distribution was obtainable.

However, NV and PLC remain separate legal entities with different shareholder constituencies and separate stock exchange listings. Shareholders cannot convert or exchange the shares of one for the shares of the other.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id328: Boards The Boards of NV and PLC have ultimate responsibility for the management, general affairs, direction, culture, performance and long-term success of our business as a whole. The Boards are one-tier boards, the same people are on both Boards and the responsibility of the Directors is collective, taking into account their respective roles as Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors. The majority of the Directors are Non-Executive Directors who essentially have a supervisory role, providing constructive challenges, strategic guidance and specialist advice. In the normal course Unilever has two Executive Directors, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO). On 1 January 2019, Alan Jope, was appointed as CEO. He was appointed as an Executive Director at the 2019 AGMs. Consequently, between 1 January 2019 and the AGMs in May 2019 Unilever only had one Executive Director.Modification of rights	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id329: Modification of rightsModifications to NV’s or PLC’s Articles of Association must be approved by a general meeting of shareholders. Any modification of the NV Articles of Association that prejudices the rights of 6% or 7% cumulative preference shareholders* of NV must be approved by three-quarters of votes cast (excluding treasury shares) at a meeting of affected holders.Under the European Takeover Directive as implemented in the Netherlands and the UK, the UK Companies Act 2006 and rules of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Unilever is required to provide information on contracts and other arrangements essential or material to the business of the Unilever Group. Other than the Foundation Agreements referred to above we believe we do not have any such contracts or arrangements.	PDF

The Director in question must provide all relevant information to the Boards, so that the Boards can decide whether a reported (potential) conflict of interest of a Director qualifies as a conflict of interest within the meaning of the relevant laws. A Director may not take part in the decision taking process of the Boards in respect of any situation in which he or she has a conflict of interest. The procedures that Unilever has put in place to deal with conflicts of interest operate effectively.	PDF

The key actions agreed by each Committee in the 2019 evaluations can be found in each Committee Report.www.unilever.com/investor-relations/agm- and-corporate-governance/board-and- management-committees/Board appointment In seeking to ensure that NV and PLC have the same Directors, the Articles of Association of NV and PLC contain provisions which are designed to ensure that both NV and PLC shareholders are presented with the same candidates for election as Directors. Anyone being elected as a Director of NV must also be elected as a Director of PLC and vice versa. Therefore, if an individual fails to be elected to both companies he or she will be unable to take his or her place on either Board.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id333: Unilever recognises the benefit to the individual and the Unilever Group of senior executives acting as directors of other companies but, to ensure outside directorships of our Executive Directors do not involve an excessive commitment or conflict of interest, the number of outside directorships of listed companies is generally limited to one per Executive Director and approval is required from the Chairman and in case of the Chairman, from the senior Independent Director.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id334: Board meetings A minimum of five face-to-face meetings are planned throughout the calendar year to consider important corporate events and actions, for example, the half-year and full-year results announcements; the development and approval of our strategy; oversight of the performance of the business; review of the risk framework; authorisation of major transactions; declaration of dividends; review of the financial plan; succession planning; review of the functioning of the Boards and their Committees; culture; workforce engagement; and review of corporate responsibility. Other ad hoc Board meetings are convened to discuss strategic, transactional and governance matters that arise. In 2019 the Boards met physically in January, March, April, July, October and November. Meetings of the Boards may be held either in London or in Rotterdam or such other locations as the Boards think fit, with one or two off-site Board meetings a year.

The Chairman sets the Boards’ agenda, ensures the Directors receive accurate, timely and clear information, promotes and facilitates constructive relationships and effective contribution of all the Executive and Non-Executive Directors, and promotes a culture of openess and debate.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id336: Engagement with employees The Boards assessed various options how to best organise the engagement with employees. Considering Unilever's global footprint and extent of operations, the Boards decided to share the responsibility for workforce engagement among all Non-Executive Directors as a collective point of contact as being the most effective option. We therefore developed a number of initiatives and events to ensure that the Non-Executive Directors can engage with the workforce and get a sense of employee sentiment at all levels, including through face- to-face meetings. To build further on this, we intend that our Non-Executive Directors will continue to hold regular face-to-face meetings with the workforce and we will incorporate additional engagement sessions alongside regular Board meetings and Board visits to Unilever sites. These will include the chance to meet and hear from cohorts of employees of all levels and have an open discussion on issues important to our employees.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id337: The report of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (NCGC) on pages 58 and 59 describes the work of the NCGC in Board appointments and recommendations for re-election. In addition, shareholders are able to nominate Directors. The procedure for shareholders to nominate Directors is contained within the document entitled ‘Appointment procedure for NV and PLC Directors’ which is available on our website. To do so they must put a resolution to both the NV and PLC AGMs in line with local requirements. Directors are appointed by shareholders by a simple majority vote at each AGM.www.unilever.com/investor-relations/agm- and-corporate-governance/board-and- management-committees/	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id338: Board induction and training All new Directors participate in a comprehensive induction programme when they join the Boards. The Chairman ensures that ongoing training is provided for Directors by way of site visits, presentations and circulated updates at (and between) Board and Board Committee meetings on, among other things, Unilever’s business, environmental, social, corporate governance, regulatory developments and investor relations matters. For example, in 2019 the Directors received presentations on M&A strategy, sustainable packaging, competitive landscape and cyber security.The Non-Executive Directors usually meet as a group, without the Executive Directors present, when there is a face-to-face Board meeting. In 2019 they met five times. The Chairman, or in his absence the Senior Independent Director/Vice- Chairman, chairs such meetings.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id339: In 2019, Non-Executive Directors attended four face-to-face workforce engagement events with a diverse range of the workforce from factory staff and new joiners through to head office staff and people with 25+ years in the company. This method of engagement allowed for discussions, covering a range of topics including: expectations for lifelong learning, the future of work, the USLP, diversity and inclusion, entrepreneurship, pay points, agility and employability. The events have been a success with positive feedback from employees and Non-Executive Directors that attended. Our Non-Executive Directors were more visible to the workforce and it encouraged greater engagement, sharing of views and feedback from employees. In addition, through engaging with a broad range of employees, the Non- Executive Directors received a new perspective on the company and our operations. This new perspective has been taken into consideration in their decision making, for example when discussing and	PDF

We therefore consider that sharing responsibility for engagement with the workforce among all Non-Executive Directors is an effective arrangement.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id341: The table showing the attendance of current Directors at Board meetings in 2019 can be found on page 49. If Directors are unable to attend a Board meeting they have the opportunity beforehand to discuss any agenda items with the Chairman. Mary Ma attended three out of four Board meetings during 2019.Independence and conflicts It is important that the Non-Executive Directors can be considered to be independent. Each year the Boards conduct a thorough review of the Non-Executive Directors’, and their related or connected persons’, relevant relationships referencing the criteria set out in ‘The Governance of Unilever’ which is derived from the relevant best practice guidelines in the Netherlands, UK and US. The Boards currently consider all our Non- Executive Directors to be independent of Unilever.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id342: Board evaluation Each year the Boards formally assess their own performance, including with respect to their composition, diversity and how effectively their members work together, with the aim of helping to improve the effectiveness of both the Boards and the Committees. At least once every three years an independent third party facilitates the evaluation. As the last external evaluation was performed in 2017, the Boards agreed to an external evaluation at the end of 2019 rolling over into 2020. In November 2019 No. 4, an independent third-party consultant, facilitated such evaluation. The evaluation consisted of individual interviews with the Directors followed by a Board discussion in January 2020, covering both the outcome of the evaluation and the proposed actions to enhance the effectiveness	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id343: We attach special importance to avoiding conflicts of interest between NV and PLC and their respective Directors. The Boards ensure that there are effective procedures in place to avoid conflicts of interest by Board members.

Pdf_Chunk_id418: These third-party policies support Unilever in evaluating risk and designing appropriate programmes to cover the diversity of market conditions and third parties it works with. For example, in 2019 Unilever began preparation for a new approach - 'RSP before Purchase Order' - which means that suppliers of products or services must be compliant with the RSP before a buyer can raise a purchase order. While as a principle Unilever seeks to work with its third parties to remediate and improve any poor practices identified through screening or auditing, those who are unwilling or unable to comply with the RSP or RBPP are subject to delisting.Code of Business PrinciplesRole of the Committee	PDF

This is vital as compliance is essential to promote and protect Unilever’s values and standards, and hence the good reputation of the Group.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id421: As the Committee is also charged with ensuring that Unilever’s reputation is protected and enhanced, consideration of the company’s influence and impact on stakeholders is central to the Committee’s duties.

The full Board will also meet the Advisory Council to share perspectives and insights.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id428: In October 2019, Unilever made two further, ambitious commitments to reduce its plastic waste and help create a circular economy for plastics by 2025. The first is to halve its use of virgin plastic by reducing its absolute use of plastic packaging by more than 100,000 tonnes and accelerating its use of recycled plastic. This commitment makes Unilever the first major global consumer goods company to commit to an absolute plastics reduction across its portfolio. The second is to help collect and process more plastic packaging than it sells.Product safety	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id429: Product safetyHigh quality products that are safe to use are the foundation of Unilever’s business. Unilever’s approach to product safety is based on risk identification and mitigation. Its approach encompasses all aspects of the value chain – from development, sourcing, manufacture and transport to consumer use and disposal of the product. This approach turns on the application of rigorous standards based on sound science and the principle of Safe by Design and Safe in Execution.Strive Masiyiwa Chair of the Corporate Responsibility CommitteeYoungme MoonFeike SijbesmaUnilever is making progress towards its existing USLP targets to ensure all its plastic packaging is reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025, and to use at least 25% recycled plastic in its packaging, also by 2025, (see page 44).	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id430: Unilever has put in place a number of programmes to drive up quality. Examples include its C4G programme for suppliers which reduces quality non-conformance on in-bound supply to Unilever manufacturing sites and new rules that support rapid innovation and risk management. In 2019, total marketplace incidents originating in Unilever’s supply chain reduced by 34% compared to 2018 and the number of supplier incidents (detected via incoming raw material and packaging checks) reduced by 45%. Greater use of digital capabilities is also improving efficiency and responsiveness, for example by using its Digital Voice of the Consumer application, Unilever is able to quickly collate and analyse consumer feedback to improve product quality more rapidly.Reviewing the new commitments, the Committee commended Unilever on the level of ambition and the lead it had taken in tackling this important issue.MCIP	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id431: MCIPUnilever’s Reward Framework includes the Management Co-investment Plan (MCIP), a long-term incentive plan that is linked to financial and USLP performance (see page 62).To come to a view on the USLP, the Corporate Responsibility Committee and the Compensation Committee evaluate performance against a Sustainability Progress Index (SPI).SustainabilityAcross the year, the Committee discussed the evolution of Unilever’s thinking on sustainability as part of its integrated business strategy. Unilever is building on the learning from the USLP to shape new ambitions that tackle today’s urgent environmental and social issues such as climate change and inequality. The Group’s industry-leading announcement on plastic packaging (see below) illustrates how it is approaching this task and challenging itself to set far-reaching goals.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id432: The SPI is a two-fold assessment that captures quantitative and qualitative elements. Firstly, it considers the 2018 performance on USLP targets reported in Unilever’s online Sustainable Living Report, alongside performance evidenced in a number of sustainability ratings and indices. These targets illustrate how Unilever aims to address a number of its principal risks, such as brand preference, climate change, supply chain and ethics (see Principal risks on pages 35 to 39). The second part of the assessment takes into account Unilever’s wider progress on sustainabilityThe Committee supported Unilever’s thinking, advising that a distinctive corporate agenda is key to delivering sustainable growth and ensuring Unilever remains a sustainability leader.

Pdf_Chunk_id448: Engaging with shareholdersCommittee members and attendanceAt the beginning of the year I spoke with investors to hear their views on the implementation of our remuneration policy, as set out in the DRR 2018, which was received with high levels of support at our AGMs. We subsequently undertook extensive consultation with our investors and their representative bodies to discuss our proposals for the pay of our Executive and Non- Executive Directors (as detailed on page 64), our approach to the Dutch implementation of the European Shareholder Rights Directive (SRD), the adjustments to the targets for our inflight incentive schemes as set out on page 62 and target setting for the 2020 incentives.Attendance 5/5Vittorio Colao Chair Nils Andersen (Member as from 13 November 2019) Marijn Dekkers Andrea Jung Mary Ma (Member until 31 August 2019)1/15/54/53/4	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id449: 1/15/54/53/4As a result, the final overall outcome for 2019 Annual Bonus was 82% of target. The Committee reviewed this formulaic outcome against the quality of results and determined that it was in line with overall business performance and consequently made no discretionary adjustments. Accordingly, the Committee confirmed a bonus of 82% of target opportunity for both the CEO Alan Jope (resulting in a bonus of 123% of Fixed Pay against a target of 150%), and the CFO Graeme Pitkethly (resulting in a bonus of 98% of Fixed Pay against a target of 120%). Both Directors elected to invest the maximum of 67% of their gross bonus into Unilever shares through the Management Co-Investment Plans (MCIP) (meaning they invested their entire net bonus plus additional personal funds), to be held for a minimum period of four years. Further details are on page 64.	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id451: I was encouraged that shareholders endorse our approach towards Executive Pay by which we make changes that are aligned with the wider workforce and aim to move the CEO gradually towards the pay level of the market median benchmark, subject to continued good performance. Investors also appreciated our strict approach to target setting and our alignment between pay and strategy, which resulted in a change in weightings for the 2020 annual bonus to reflect management’s focus on delivering growth as a key priority (further detail on page 64). Investors also expressed a wide range of preferences for the performance measures to be used for incentive plans, which the Committee will review in further detail in the context of the upcoming remuneration policy renewal in 2021.Letter from the Chair	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id452: Letter from the ChairDear shareholders, As the Compensation Committee Chair, I am pleased to present Unilever’s Directors’ Remuneration Report (DRR) 2019. In the sections below, I set out remuneration outcomes for 2019 and describe the Committee’s activities in the year.Looking ahead a key focus for 2020 is on growth and in particular delivering ambitious USG aspirations. As a result the bonus for 2020 has a higher weighting of 50% on the USG measure, as disclosed in more detail on page 64.Executive Director Fixed Pay increasesBusiness performance and remuneration 2019 has been another year of continuing balance of growth, improved profitability and strong cash generation. This was a solid set of full year results, although the results on growth and margin were short of the mid-point targets set at the start of the year, due to the marked slowdown in some of Unilever’s high growth markets.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id453: The Committee has approved Fixed Pay increases of 4% for the CEO and 3% for the CFO, effective from 1 January 2020. This is in line with the average increase awarded to the wider Unilever workforce in 2019 of 3.6%. These increases were awarded to recognise the strong leadership of both individuals in 2019, which was Alan Jope’s first year in the CEO role and a year of transformation for Unilever generally. We also wanted to recognise Graeme Pitkethly’s seniority in his role, coming into his 5th year as CFO.Outcomes for 2017-2019 GSIP and MCIP	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id454: Outcomes for 2017-2019 GSIP and MCIPOver the past three years Unilever has delivered consistent top and bottom line growth with USG CAGR of 3.0% and margin improvement at an average of +83 bps per year. Unilever also generated exceptional cumulative operating cash flow of €22.2 billion in the same period and finished 7th out of 19 in our peer group for total shareholder return (TSR). This ranking is based on average share prices over December and so incorporates the impact on Unilever’s share price of the December 2019 sales update announcement. This performance against 2017-2019 targets resulted in an outcome for the Global Share Incentive Plan (GSIP) of 119%. Having confirmed that this outcome reflected the underlying performance of the business over the plan cycle, the Committee confirmed a vesting ratio of 119% (corresponding to 60% of a maximum of 200% for the Executive Directors), as detailed on page 67.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id455: The Committee has made various technical adjustments to the way we assess business performance outcomes for the purpose of determining incentive awards as described below. The Committee has carefully assessed these adjustments, to ensure that they make the targets set for incentives not materially easier or more difficult to achieve (see page 62).When our CEO Alan Jope was appointed on 1 January 2019 he was appointed with Fixed Pay 14% below that of what the Committee proposed for his predecessor and at the lower quartile of our remuneration benchmarking peer group, despite Unilever being one of the largest companies in this peer group. This positioning was intentional, given Alan’s internal promotion on appointment. However, subject to Alan’s continuing good performance the Committee will, over time, continue to review his Fixed Pay positioning and progress this towards the market median benchmark.Outcomes for 2019 annual bonus	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id456: Outcomes for 2019 annual bonusUnderlying Sales Growth (USG) in the year was 2.9%, below our par bonus target of 3.3%. This was the result of various challenges including the rapid economic slowdown in South Asia and distributor stock resets and slowing market conditions in West Africa.When assessing all incentive outcomes in the round, the Committee considered the disappointing sales performance in the second half of 2019, including the factors behind it and concluded that the pay outcomes reflected this appropriately.Developed markets declined with a volume decrease in Europe due to a strong comparator from hot weather in the previous year. Finally, while there are early signs of improving performance in North America, a full recovery there will take time.In 2017 we extended the performance period of our MCIP plan from three years to four years. Consequently, there is no MCIP award vesting at the end of 2019.60Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019Governance Report	PDF

See page 62.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id461: During the year Chairman and Non-Executive Director fees were reviewed. No Director was involved in deciding their own pay. Independent benchmarking shows that some of the roles are paid below market median rates, despite Unilever’s scale and complexity significantly exceeding the median for the peer group. In addition, the time commitments of certain roles have increased due to further expansion of tasks and the constantly evolving regulatory framework. Following this review an increase was approved of GBP 25,000 for the Chairman’s all inclusive fee, and an increase of GBP 3,000 for the members of the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee. The basic Non- Executive Director fee remains unchanged. Further details can be found on page 71.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id462: In the forthcoming financial year we will continue to implement the approved remuneration policy. We will also continue to embed our executive remuneration arrangements across our entire management population worldwide in line with the New Reward Framework, adopted in 2018 for our Executive Directors. This implementation has been working successfully and has resulted in strong levels of participation in MCIP through which long-term personal commitment through share ownership drives reward at Unilever. The Committee will further review progress ahead of the remuneration policy renewal at the 2021 AGMs to ensure the new policy continues to align the interests of our wide range of stakeholders and supports the delivery of the new Compass (see page 9), including short and long-term performance and value creation (see 'How we take into account the views of employees and the level of support in society' in this letter).Unilever’s remuneration policy	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id463: Unilever’s remuneration policyThe Netherlands has implemented the SRD with effect from 2020. Unilever is pleased to see these new reporting requirements which more closely align the Dutch regulations with what we already report under the UK regulations and the UK Corporate Governance Code. Key provisions of the SRD were already in place at Unilever including an annual advisory vote on the implementation of our remuneration policy for NV shareholders. Earlier in the year we were pleased to see the high levels of support we received from investors at our 2019 AGMs: PLC 95.62% and NV 96.92% in favour of the remuneration report.During 2019 the Committee assessed our remuneration policy for compliance to the SRD. We believe that our policy already complies with the SRD’s requirements. As such, we will next put the policy to a vote at both the PLC and NV AGMs in 2021.

Pdf_Chunk_id465: Also, in 2019 the Committee followed up with two sessions on Workforce Pay to understand the remuneration structures and policies in place for the broader employee population. The Committee takes this context, together with the external climate, into account when making decisions on executive pay. The Committee was also pleased to see an uplift in response to the UniVoice employee engagement survey, which gives employees the opportunity to provide feedback and express their views on a variety of topics, including pay.under Section 172 of the UK Companies Act 2006 (see page 12) to consider the impact of what we do on our multiple stakeholders. These considerations shape the way the Committee looks at pay and sets pay rates for our Executive and Non-Executive Directors relative to our wider workforce.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id466: In establishing the New Reward Framework, Unilever took into account feedback on reward from employees, both through formal surveys and in focus groups. Having been introduced to the principles driving the New Reward Framework, employees consulted said they felt more aligned with Unilever’s strategy and the owner’s mentality than with previous frameworks. Through this exercise we also learned that more junior employees would appreciate a softening of the current hard link between bonus and MCIP to allow them to invest some of their Fixed Pay into MCIP rather being able to invest only from bonus. The Committee will take this feedback into account for the remuneration policy renewal at the 2021 AGMs.	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id468: Finally, with the introduction of the Sustainability Progress Index as a 25% performance metric in our MCIP in 2017, we have further strengthened the linkage between our remuneration policy and Unilever’s identity, values, mission and contribution made to society. These considerations have been integrated further in our new Unilever Compass: Purpose-Led, Future-Fit (to be released in 2020).

However, the standard requires lease payments to be split between capital repayments and interest and therefore impacts various cash flow subtotals. The result of adopting IFRS 16 has benefited our measure of FCF as well as Cumulative Operating Cash flow as defined for the GSIP. As such, the Committee has reflected the benefit of IFRS 16 in the 2019 Annual Bonus target originally set for FCF by increasing the target range from €4.2 billion-€6.2 billion to €4.7 billion-€6.7 billion.Committee reviewed the estimated impact of the Horlicks acquisition across all performance measures for all inflight long-term incentive plans to ensure they remain appropriate.Technical adjustmentsUnderlying sales growth methodologyDuring 2019 Unilever updated its definition of USG to change the way we take into account hyperinflationary economies.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id470: The Horlicks acquisition is expected to have a positive impact on underlying Earnings per Share (EPS) growth and a negative impact on ROIC. The Committee determined to adjust relevant inflight targets to adjust for the estimated positive and negative impacts of this acquisition to ensure that management are not unfairly penalised or rewarded for this acquisition. The like-for-like adjustment has the effect of reducing the ROIC targets and increasing the EPS targets. The Committee also wanted to ensure that management are incentivised for the successful implementation of this acquisition and therefore determined that adjusting targets at this stage is a more effective approach than adjusting outcomes to remove the impact of the acquisition at the time the awards vest.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id471: Previously our definition of USG excluded the impact of all price growth from countries where the impact of consumer price inflation rates had escalated to extreme levels (currently Argentina, Venezuela and Zimbabwe). After a full year of hyperinflationary conditions in Argentina, one of our larger markets, it became clear that these conditions would persist for some time. As a result, the definition has been updated so that a normalised level of price growth will be included in USG for hyperinflationary countries, which will be capped at an annual rate that is equivalent to approximately 2% per month compounded. This cap is derived from one of the indicators of hyperinflation cited in IAS 29 and ensures that any price growth above this level will be excluded from USG. The new USG definition better reflects Unilever’s normal pricing actions, distinct from those taken to respond to hyperinflationary conditions.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id472: The Committee has also reflected the benefit for the year 2019 in the 2017-2019 GSIP target for Cumulative Operating Cash flow which has resulted in an increase in the target range from €16.5 billion-€21.5 billion to €17.1 billion-€22.1 billion. For the 2018-2020 GSIP this resulted in an increase in the target range from €19 billion-€24 billion to €20.2 billion-€25.2 billion. In addition, upon adoption of IFRS 16 the Group recognised leases on the balance sheet with a right-of- use asset and related lease liability. This has resulted in an increase to property, plant and equipment, and thus invested capital, which is used to calculate Return on Invested Capital (ROIC). To reflect the impact of the new accounting standard, the Committee has adjusted the ROIC target ranges set for the 2017-2020 and 2018-2021 MCIP to include the dilutive effect of IFRS 16.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id473: The Committee took into account the estimated impact of the Horlicks acquisition in setting performance targets for 2019-2022 MCIP. However, the consideration for the acquisition is predominantly in shares in Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) and the share price movement of HUL since the announcement of the acquisition will have a significant impact on ROIC in 2019- 2022. Accordingly, the Committee reduced the ROIC target for MCIP 2019-2022 to reflect this impact as per the share price of HUL on 20 February 2020. The adjusted targets for all inflight long-term incentive plans are set out below. The committee will review again the impact of the share price of HUL at deal completion and will evaluate if any re-alignment of targets will be necessary. Disclosure of the final targets will be posted at:	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id474: The Committee determined to make the same change to USG for incentive purposes so that the incentive outcomes align fully with our reported results. As a result, the USG target in our 2019 annual bonus was increased from 3.0% to 3.3%. Prior year numbers have also been restated as per our announcement in September 2019, when calculating the multi-year USG growth in our inflight long-term incentive plans.These are all formulaic adjustments which fully reflect the change in accounting standard.Impact of Horlicks acquisition on inflight MCIP awardsIFRS 16 ‘leases’: adjustments to inflight incentive plansThe Committee set long-term incentive plan targets assuming there will be a certain level of M&A each year.

Pdf_Chunk_id478: Implementation of the remuneration policy for Executive Directors The remuneration of our Executive Directors was set in line with the principles for remuneration of the Group. Reward should support our business strategy and should be sufficient to attract and retain high-performing individuals without paying more than necessary. Being able to share in the success of Unilever is important across the workforce. The Executive Directors, other members of the ULE and most Unilever employees are rewarded on the basis of the same performance measures for the annual bonus. This helps drive a shared culture and alignment with Unilever’s purpose, strategy and values and allows employees to share in the same success as the most senior employees in Unilever.

Pdf_Chunk_id490: The target range for Underlying Earnings Per Share Growth has been reduced by 2% at the top end from the MCIP 2019-2022 cycle. When setting this target, the Committee believe that delivering 8% CAGR in EPS over the next four years would be an exceptional achievement and is a suitable stretch target. This target assumes a stronger Underlying Sales Growth performance, a more moderate benefit from operating leverage than seen in prior years as we reach our strategic margin ambition, and continues to reflect the increasing effect of exchange rate volatility in delivering current currency Underlying EPS growth over a four-year plan cycle. Historically FX has been a headwind on EPS, and unlike some peers our EPS targets are not adjusted to remove FX impacts.

Accordingly, the year-on-year comparison reflects the appointment of Alan Jope as CEO in 2019 following Paul Polman’s retirement at the end of 2018. The 2019 numbers reflect that Alan Jope's Fixed Pay was set at a lower level than Paul Polman's. The numbers are further impacted by fluctuation in the exchange rates used to convert pay elements denominated in pounds sterling to euros for reporting purposes in 2018. From 2019 the CEO and CFO pay elements are paid in euros. Where relevant, amounts for 2018 have been translated using the average exchange rate over 2018 (€1 = £0.8835), and amounts for 2019 have been translated using the average exchange rate over 2019 (€1 = £0.8799).

Pdf_Chunk_id539: Annual bonus and long-term incentives (GSIP and MCIP) for the UK and Dutch employees were not calculated following the statutory method for single- figure pay. Instead, variable pay figures were calculated using: • • •target annual bonus values for the respective year (so disregarding personal performance multipliers, which equal out across the population as a whole); target GSIP values for the respective year; and MCIP values calculated at an appropriate average for the relevant Work Level of employees, i.e. an average 45% investment of bonus for WL3 employees; 60% for WL4-5 employees; and 100% for WL6 employees.Fixed pay figures reflect all elements of pay (including allowances) and benefits paid in cash.73Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019Directors' remuneration report continuedCEO pay ratio comparisonThe table below is included to meet UK requirements and shows how pay for the CEO compares to our UK employees at the 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile.

Pdf_Chunk_id541: Option A was used to calculate the pay and benefits (including pension) of the 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile UK employees because the data was readily available for all UK employees of the group and Option A is the most accurate method (as it is based on total full-time equivalent total reward for all UK employees for the relevant financial year). Figures are calculated by reference to 31 December 2019, and the respective salary and pay and benefits figures for each quartile are set out in the table above. Full-time equivalent figures are calculated on a pro-rated basis.Variable pay figures for the UK employees are calculated on the basis set out in the paragraph for other work levels below the ‘CEO/CFO Pay Ratio Comparison’ table. The reason for this is it would be unduly onerous to recalculate these figures when, based on a sample, the impact of such recalculation is expected to be minimal.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id542: Year-on-year comparisons reflects the appointment of Alan Jope as CEO in 2019 following Paul Polman’s retirement at the end of 2018 and as a result the CEO pay ratio has decreased from 2018 to 2019 since Alan Jope’s Fixed Pay was set at a level lower than Paul Polman’s. For the overall UK employee calculation pay and benefit values have increased by approximately 20% due to inclusion of the pension in 2019. Salary for the UK employees has increased minimally because of the change in the New Reward Framework for the WL3s, despite the fact that the workforce in numbers decreased by 3.8% from 2018 to 2019.

As result of this new definition USG figures for 2016, 2017 and 2018 have been restated compared to previous disclosures. The CEO and CFO % change from 2016 to 2017 is due to a higher MCIP and GSIP performance ratio compared to the previous years.

Pdf_Chunk_id587: The key audit matterOur response and resultsRevenue is measured net of rebates, price reductions, incentives given to customers, promotional couponing and trade communication costs (‘’discounts’’). Certain discounts for goods sold in the year are only finalised when the precise amounts are known and revenue therefore includes an estimate of variable consideration.Revenue recognition - DiscountsProceduresThe primary procedures we performed to address this key audit matter included the following:As discussed in the report of the Audit Committee, note 2 (segment information), note 13 (trade and other current receivables) and note 14 (trade payable and other liabilities), the rebate accrual was €3,476 million as of 31 December 2019 and €3,576 million as of 31 December 2018.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id588: Tested certain internal controls within the revenue process including controls over the calculation of the rebate accrual and management review over the rebate accrual. Within the relevant Group’s markets, used the prior year rebate accrual together with our understanding of current year developments to form an expectation of the rebate accrual at 31 December 2019. We compared this expectation against the actual rebate accrual, completing further corroborative inquiries and obtained underlying documentation as appropriate. Tested a sample of the rebate accrual and compared to underlying documentation, including the contracts. Critically assessed manual journals posted to revenue to identify unusual or irregular items and obtained underlying documentation. Developed an expectation of the current year revenue based on trend analysis information, taking into account historical sales and returns information, and our understanding of each market and sector experience.

We compared this expectation against actual revenue and, where relevant, completed further corroborative inquiries and obtained underlying documentation as appropriate. Assessed the Group’s disclosures in respect of the rebate accrual.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id590: The variable consideration represents the portion of discounts that are not directly deducted on the invoice and is complex as a result of diversity in the terms in contractual arrangements with customers. The unsettled portion of the variable consideration results in discounts due to customers per 31 December 2019 (“rebate accrual”).Therefore, there is a risk of revenue being misstated as a result of incorrect calculations of the variable consideration.Within revenue recognition we identified the rebate accrual as a key audit matter, as in a number of markets the rebate accrual is significant and the terms in contractual arrangements with customers are not uniform.Our resultsTherefore this is considered to be an area which had a significant effect on our overall audit strategy and allocation of resources in planning and completing our audit as significant effort was required in evaluating the contractual arrangements and the related rebate accrual.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id591: The results of our testing were satisfactory (2018: satisfactory).There is also a risk that revenue may be overstated due to fraud through manipulation of the rebate accrual recognised resulting from the pressure local management may feel to achieve performance targets.80Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019Financial StatementsThe key audit matterOur response and resultsIn Brazil, there is a high degree of complexity involved in the local indirect tax regimes (both state and federal), largely related to a 2001 reorganisation of Unilever’s Brazil corporate structure.

Pdf_Chunk_id593: Tested certain internal controls within the indirect tax process including controls around the assessment of the outcome of investigations and the quantification of the potential economic outflow. We involved local indirect tax professionals with specialised skills and knowledge to assist in assessing the appropriateness of the contingent liabilities compared to the nature of the exposures, applicable regulations and related correspondence with the tax authorities. Through inquiry with the Unilever Group’s external lawyers and inspection of relevant information we assessed historical and recent judgements passed by the court authorities in considering any legal precedent or case law. We inspected legal opinions from third party lawyers and obtained formal confirmations from the Unilever Group’s external lawyers.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id594: We identified the assessment of indirect tax contingent liabilities in Brazil as a key audit matter. Due to the complex nature of the Brazilian local tax regimes and jurisprudence, there is a high degree of judgement applied by the Unilever Group with respect to this matter, given the high degree of estimation uncertainty has a particularly wide potential extent of possible outcomes. Complex auditor's judgement was also required in assessing the outcome of investigations by the authorities.Our results The results of our testing were satisfactory (2018: satisfactory) and we considered the Brazilian indirect tax contingent liability disclosures to be acceptable (2018: acceptable).

Materiality for KPMG LLP’s audit of the PLC Company Accounts as a whole was set at £61 million (2018: £100 million), determined with reference to a benchmark of Unilever PLC Net Assets, of which it represents 0.8% (2018: 2.9%).We agreed to report to the Audit Committee that misstatements in excess of €20 million (2018: €20 million), €10 million (2018: €14 million) and £3 million (2018: £3 million) which are identified during the audit of the consolidated, NV Company Accounts and PLC Company Accounts respectively, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds.Overall scope of our audit	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id604: Overall scope of our auditThe Group operates through a significant number of legal entities and these form reporting components that are primarily country based. To provide sufficient coverage over the Group’s key audit matters, we performed audits of 15 components (2018: 15), which are included within ‘Audit for group reporting purposes’ below, as well as audits of account balances including revenue and the related accounts receivables balances at a further 23 (2018: 23) components which are included within ‘Audit of account balances’ below. The latter were not individually financially significant enough to require an audit for group reporting purposes but were included in the scope of our group reporting work in order to provide additional coverage.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id605: The Group operates centralised operating centres in China, India, Mexico, Philippines and Poland that perform accounting and reporting activities alongside related controls. Together, these operating centres process a substantial portion of the Group’s transactions. The outputs from the centralised operating centres are included in the financial information of the reporting components they service and therefore they are not separate reporting components. Each of the operating centres is subject to specified audit procedures. Further audit procedures are performed at each reporting component to cover matters not covered at the centralised operating centres and together this results in audits for group reporting purposes on those reporting components.The components within the scope of our work accounted for the following percentages of the Group's results:Total profits and losses that made up Group profit before taxationGroup total assetsNumber of componentsGroup revenue	PDF

A substantial portion of these components utilise the operating centres and are therefore subject to audit procedures performed at these operating centres. For these components, we performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these.82Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019Financial Statements3.

Pdf_Chunk_id608: 3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit continuedThe Group audit team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the key audit matters detailed above and the information to be reported back. The Group audit team approved the component materialities, which ranged from €1 million to €209 million (2018: €1 million to €275 million), having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components. The work on components was performed by component auditors.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id609: The Group audit team visited locations in Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Netherlands, South Africa, Switzerland, UK, and USA (2018: Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Netherlands, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, UK, USA and Vietnam), Telephone and/or online meetings were also held with these component auditors and the majority of the others that were not physically visited. The findings reported to the Group audit team were discussed in more detail with component auditors and any further work required by the Group audit team was then performed by the component auditors.The work on 36 of the 38 components (2018: 36 of the 38 components) was performed by component auditors (KPMG member firms) and the audit of the parent companies, were performed by the Group audit team.Scope in relation to irregularities	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id610: Scope in relation to irregularitiesFraud In accordance with the Dutch and UK standards on auditing we are responsible for obtaining reasonable assurance that the financial statements taken as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.In our process of identifying fraud risks we assessed events or conditions that indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud (‘fraud risk factors’) to determine how fraud risks are relevant to our audit. In this risk assessment we made use of our own forensic professionals with specialised skills and knowledge to assist us in identifying the fraud risks. We communicated identified fraud risks throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit. This included communication from the group to component audit teams of relevant fraud risks identified at group level.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id611: Based on the auditing standards we addressed two fraud risks that were relevant to our audit, in relation to revenue recognition and management override of controls. Based upon our analysis of fraud risk factors, we have not identified any additional fraud risks.Our audit procedures included an evaluation of the design, implementation as well as the operating effectiveness of internal controls relevant to mitigate these risks. We also performed substantive audit procedures, including detailed testing of high risk journal entries and the procedures included within our response to the revenue recognition - discounts key audit matter described in section 2 of this report. Through these procedures, we did not identify any material actual or suspected incidences of fraud.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id612: In determining the audit procedures we made use of the Group’s evaluation in relation to fraud risk management (prevention, detections and response), including the set-up of ethical standards to create a culture of honesty.We communicated our risk assessment and audit response to the Directors and other management and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board. Our audit procedures differ from a specific forensic fraud investigation, which investigation often has a more in-depth character. We do note that our audit is based on the procedures described in line with applicable auditing standards and are not primarily designed to detect fraud.Laws and regulations We have evaluated facts and circumstances in order to assess laws and regulations relevant to the Group. In this evaluation we made use of our own forensic professionals with specialised skills and knowledge to assist us in evaluating the facts and circumstances.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id613: We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general and sector experience, through discussion with the Directors and other management (as required by auditing standards) and discussed with the Directors and other management the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations.We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group to component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at Group level.The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id614: Firstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including taxation and financial reporting (including related company legislation) and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items. Secondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect: • Competition legislation (reflecting the Group’s involvement in a number of ongoing investigations by national competition authorities). • Employment legislation (reflecting the Group’s significant and geographically diverse work force). • Health and safety regulation (reflecting the nature of the Group’s production and distribution	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id615: • Health and safety regulation (reflecting the nature of the Group’s production and distribution processes). • Consumer product law such as product safety and product claims (reflecting the nature of the Group’s diverse product base). • Contract legislation (reflecting the potential for the Group to infringe trademarks, copyright and patents). • Data privacy (requirements from existing data privacy laws). •	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id616: Environmental regulation (reflecting environmental impact restrictions, waste and contamination related to the Group’s production and distribution processes).Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the Directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Through these procedures, we did not identify any additional actual or suspected non-compliance outside of those previously identified by the Group in each of the above areas. We considered the effect of this as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items. The identified actual or suspected non-compliance was not sufficiently significant to our audit to result in our response being identified as a key audit matter.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id617: We note that our audit is not primarily designed to detect non-compliance with laws and regulations and the Directors and other management are responsible for such internal control as the Directors and other management of the Company determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to errors or fraud, including compliance with laws and regulations. Additionally, owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id618: The more distant non-compliance with laws and regulations (irregularities) is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it. In addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of irregularities, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.83Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019Independent Auditors’ Reports continued3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit continuedScope in relation to going concern	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id619: Scope in relation to going concernThe Directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Companies or the Group or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the Companies’ and the Group’s financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements (“the going concern period”).	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id620: Our responsibility is to conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors’ conclusions and, had there been a material uncertainty related to going concern, to make reference to that in this audit report. However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of reference to a material uncertainty in this auditor's report is not a guarantee that the Group and the Companies will continue in operation.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id621: In our evaluation of the Directors’ going concern assessment and conclusions, we considered the inherent risks to the Group’s and Companies’ business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group’s and Companies’ financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks that we considered most likely to adversely affect the Group’s and Companies’ available financial resources over this period were: • continued slowdown in the broader macro-economic environment and therefore market growth; • • external pressures on gross margin through cost price inflation.increased global and local competition; and	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id622: increased global and local competition; andAs these were risks that could potentially cast significant doubt on the Group’s and the Companies' ability to continue as a going concern, we considered sensitivities over the level of available financial resources indicated by the Group’s financial forecasts taking account of reasonably possible (but not unrealistic) adverse effects that could arise from these risks individually and collectively and evaluated the achievability of the actions the Directors consider they would take to improve the position should the risks materialise. We also considered realistic second order impacts, such as a major IT data breach, the loss of all material litigation cases and Brexit which could result in a rapid reduction of available financial resources.We report on going concern as part of the section ‘Report on the other information included in the Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019’ in this report.We have nothing to report on going concern	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id635: Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud, other irregularities (see above), or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud, other irregularities or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities	PDF

Accounting information and policies The accounting policies adopted are the same as those which were applied for the previous financial year, except as set out below under the heading ‘Recent accounting developments’.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id654: In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the balances in individual group companies are translated from their functional currency into euros. Apart from the financial statements of group companies in hyperinflationary economies (see below), the income statement, the cash flow statement and all other movements in assets and liabilities are translated at average rates of exchange as a proxy for the transaction rate, or at the transaction rate itself if more appropriate. Assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id655: Basis of consolidation The two parent companies, NV and PLC, together with their group companies, operate as a single economic entity (the Unilever Group, also referred to as Unilever or the Group). NV and PLC have the same Directors and are linked by a series of agreements, including an Equalisation Agreement, which are designed so that the positions of the shareholders of both companies are as closely as possible the same as if they held shares in a single company.The financial statements of group companies whose functional currency is the currency of a hyperinflationary economy are adjusted for inflation and then translated into euros using the balance sheet exchange rate. Amounts shown for prior years for comparative purposes are not modified. To determine the existence of hyperinflation, the Group assesses the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the economic environment of the country, such as the cumulative inflation rate over the previous three years.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id656: The Equalisation Agreement provides that both companies adopt the same accounting principles. It also requires that dividends and other rights and benefits attaching to each ordinary share of NV, be equal in value to those rights and benefits attaching to each ordinary share of PLC, as if each such unit of capital formed part of the ordinary share capital of one and the same company.The ordinary share capital of NV and PLC is translated in accordance with the Equalisation Agreement. The difference between the value for PLC and the value by applying the year-end rate of exchange is taken to other reserves (see note 15B on page 118).	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id657: Due to the operational and contractual arrangements referred to above, NV and PLC form a single reporting entity for the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the financial statements of Unilever are presented by both NV and PLC as their respective consolidated financial statements. Group companies included in the consolidation are those companies controlled by NV or PLC. Control exists when the Group has the power to direct the activities of an entity so as to affect the return on investment.The effect of exchange rate changes during the year on net assets of foreign operations is recorded in equity. For this purpose net assets include loans between group companies and any related foreign exchange contracts where settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id658: The net assets and results of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control. The results of disposed businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements up to their date of disposal, being the date control ceases.The Group applies hedge accounting to certain exchange differences arising between the functional currencies of a foreign operation and NV or PLC as appropriate, regardless of whether the net investment is held directly or through an intermediate parent. Differences arising on retranslation of a financial liability designated as a foreign currency net investment hedge are recorded in equity to the extent that the hedge is effective. These differences are reported within profit or loss to the extent that the hedge is ineffective.Intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id659: Intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated.Companies legislation and accounting standards The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU), IFRIC Interpretations and in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Civil Code in the Netherlands and the UK Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. They are also in compliance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).Cumulative exchange differences arising since the date of transition to IFRS of 1 January 2004 are reported as a separate component of other reserves. In the event of disposal or part disposal of an interest in a group company either through sale or as a result of a repayment of capital, the cumulative exchange difference is recognised in the income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal of group companies.

As a result, application of IAS 29 ‘Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies’ has been applied to all Unilever entities whose functional currency is the Argentinian Peso for 2018 and 2019. The application of IAS 29 includes: •These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.

The functional currencies of NV and PLC are euros and sterling respectively. Items included in the financial statements of individual group companies are recorded in their respective functional currency which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which each entity operates.

Pdf_Chunk_id662: The main effects of the Group consolidated financial statements for 2019 are: • Total assets are reduced by €42 million; • • • Monetary gain recognised of €32 million.Foreign currency transactions in individual group companies are translated into functional currency using exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses from settlement of these transactions, and from translation of monetary assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates, are recognised in the income statement except when deferred in equity as qualifying hedges.Turnover is reduced by €14 million; Operating profit is reduced by €11 million; and91Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Unilever Group continued1.

Pdf_Chunk_id663: 1. Accounting information and policies continuedCritical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements in the application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future period affected.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id664: Utilisation of tax losses and recognition of other deferred tax assets – The Group operates in many countries and is subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Management uses judgement to assess the recoverability of tax assets such as whether there will be sufficient future taxable profits to utilise losses – see note 6B. Likelihood of occurrence of provisions and contingent liabilities – events can occur where there is uncertainty over future obligations. Judgement is required to determine if an outflow of economic resources is probable, or possible but not probable. Where it is probable, a liability is recognised and further judgement is used to determine the level of the provision. Where it is possible but not probable, further judgement is used to determine if the likelihood is remote, in which case no disclosures are provided; if the likelihood is not remote then judgement is used to determine the contingent liability disclosed.

Pdf_Chunk_id666: The following estimates are those that management believe have the most significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are: •Measurement of defined benefit obligations – the valuations of the Group’s defined benefit pension plan obligations are dependent on a number of assumptions. These include discount rates, inflation and life expectancy of scheme members. Details of these assumptions and sensitivities are in note 4B. Measurement of consideration and assets and liabilities acquired as part of business combinations. See note 21 for further information. Estimates are required to value the assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations. Intangible assets such as brands are commonly a core part of an acquired business as they allow us to obtain more value than would otherwise be possible.	PDF

In recognising and measuring lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, the Group applied judgement in determining whether each contract is or contains a lease. This included an assessment about whether the contract depends on a specified asset, whether the Group obtains substantially all the economic benefits from the use of that asset, and whether the Group has theThe following judgements are those that management believe have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Group’s financial statements: •	PDF

The Group also exercised judgement in determining the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with the impact of options to extend or terminatethe lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised.Recent accounting developments Adopted by the groupThe Group applied for the first-time amendments to the following standards from 1 January 2019.Key requirements or changes in accounting policyApplicable standardImplementation progress and expected impact	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id669: Applicable standardImplementation progress and expected impactThe Group has adopted IFRS 16 Leases in its reporting from 1 January 2019, applying the standard using the ‘full retrospective’ approach, and amounts relating to the years ended 31 December 2018 and 2017 have been restated in these financial statements.This standard changes the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. In particular it requires lessees to record all leases on the balance sheet with exemptions available for low value and short-term leases. At the commencement of a lease, a lessee recognises lease payments (lease liability) and an asset representing the right to use the asset during the lease term (leased asset). Lessees subsequently reduce the lease liability when paid and recognise depreciation on the leased asset.IFRS 16 ‘Leases’	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id670: IFRS 16 ‘Leases’The Group has recognised all leases on its balance sheet upon transition to IFRS 16, except for short-term leases (less than a year) and leases for low-value assets.The impact of adopting IFRS 16 on the Group’s financial statements is further detailed in note 24.A lease liability is remeasured upon the occurrence of certain events such as a change in the lease term or a change in an index or rate used to determine lease payments. The remeasurement normally also adjusts the leased asset.The standard has no impact on the actual cash flows of a group. However the standard requires the capitalisation, and subsequent depreciation, of costs that were previously expensed as paid which impacts disclosures of cash flows within the cash flow statement. The amounts previously expensed as operating cash outflows are instead capitalised and presented as financing cash outflows.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id671: This interpretation clarifies how entities should reflect uncertainties over income tax treatments.The Group applies judgement in identifying uncertainties over income tax treatments and has adjusted its uncertain tax provisions to be in line with the new criteria.

The expected impact and progress is shown below. In addition to the above, based on an initial review the Group does not currently believe adoption of the following standard/amendments will have a material impact on the consolidated results or financial position of the Group.Applicable standardKey requirements or changes in accounting policy	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id673: Applicable standardKey requirements or changes in accounting policyThe amendments modify specific hedge accounting requirements so entities can continue to forecast future cash flows assuming that the interest rate benchmark will continue despite ongoing reviews of interest rate benchmark reform. As a result there is no requirement for an entity to discontinue hedge relationships or to reassess the economic relationships between hedged items and hedging instruments as a result of the uncertainties of the interest rate benchmark reform.Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7Effective from the year ending 31 December 2020We do not have material derivatives that refer to an interest rate benchmark so these amendments will not have a material impact on Unilever.

Discounts given by Unilever include rebates, price reductions and incentives given to customers, promotional couponing and trade communication costs and are based on the contractual arrangements with each customer. Discounts can either be immediately deducted from the sales value on the invoice or off-invoice and settled later through credit notes when the precise amounts are known. Rebates are generally off- invoice. Amounts provided for discounts at the end of a period require estimation; historical data and accumulated experience is used to estimate the provision using the most likely amount method and in most instances the discount can be estimated using known facts with a high level of accuracy.

Pdf_Chunk_id678: Customer contracts generally contain a single performance obligation and turnover is recognised when control of the products being sold has transferred to our customer as there are no longer any unfulfilled obligations to the customer. This is generally on delivery to the customer but depending on individual customer terms, this can be at the time of dispatch, delivery or upon formal customer acceptance. This is considered the appropriate point where the performance obligations in our contracts are satisfied as Unilever no longer has control over the inventory.Our customers have the contractual right to return goods only when authorised by Unilever. At 31 December 2019, an estimate has been made of goods that will be returned and a liability has been recognised for this amount. An asset has also been recorded for the corresponding inventory that is estimated to return to Unilever using a best estimate based on accumulated experience.	PDF

Underlying operating profit represents our measure of segment profit or loss as it is the primary measure used for the purpose of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance of segments.

Pensions and similar obligations	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id697: 4B. Pensions and similar obligationsFor defined benefit plans, operating and finance costs are recognised separately in the income statement. The amount charged to operating cost in the income statement is the cost of accruing pension benefits promised to employees over the year, plus the costs of individual events such as past service benefit changes, settlements and curtailments (such events are recognised immediately in the income statement). The amount charged or credited to finance costs is a net interest expense calculated by applying the liability discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. Any differences between the expected interest on assets and the return actually achieved, and any changes in the liabilities over the year due to changes in assumptions or experience within the plans, are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.

Pdf_Chunk_id698: The defined benefit plan surplus or deficit on the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit liabilities (using a discount rate based on high-quality corporate bonds, or a suitable alternative where there is no active corporate bond market).All defined benefit plans are subject to regular actuarial review using the projected unit method by external consultants. The Group policy is that the most material plans, representing approximately 84% of the defined benefit liabilities, are formally valued every year. Other material plans, accounting for a further 12% of the liabilities, have their liabilities updated each year. Group policy for the remaining plans requires a full actuarial valuation at least every three years. Asset values for all plans are updated every year.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id699: For defined contribution plans, the charges to the income statement are the company contributions payable, as the company’s obligation is limited to the contributions paid into the plans. The assets and liabilities of such plans are not included in the balance sheet of the Group.Description of plans	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id700: Description of plansThe Group increasingly operates a number of defined contribution plans, the assets of which are held in external funds. In certain countries the Group operates defined benefit pension plans based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service. The majority of defined benefit plans are either career average, final salary or hybrid plans and operate on a funded basis with assets held in external funds. Benefits are determined by the plan rules and are linked to inflation in some countries. Our largest plans are in the UK and Netherlands. In the UK, we operate a combination of an open career average defined benefit plan with a salary limit for benefit accrual, and a defined contribution plan. In the Netherlands, we operate a collective defined contribution plan for all new benefit accrual and a closed career average defined benefit plan for benefits built up to April 2015.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id701: The Group also provides other post-employment benefits, mainly post-employment healthcare plans in the United States. These plans are predominantly unfunded.Governance	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id702: GovernanceThe majority of the Group’s externally funded plans are established as trusts, foundations or similar entities. The operation of these entities is governed by local regulations and practice in each country, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the Trustees (or equivalent) and their composition. Where Trustees (or equivalent) are in place to operate plans, they are generally required to act on behalf of the plan’s stakeholders. They are tasked with periodic reviews of the solvency of the fund in accordance with local legislation and play a role in the long-term investment and funding strategy. The Group also has an internal body, the Pensions and Equity Committee, that is responsible for setting the company’s policies and decision- making on plan matters, including but not limited to design, funding, investments, risk management and governance.Investment strategy	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id703: The Group’s investment strategy in respect of its funded plans is implemented within the framework of the various statutory requirements of the territories where the plans are based. The Group has developed policy guidelines for the allocation of assets to different classes with the objective of controlling risk and maintaining the right balance between risk and long-term returns in order to limit the cost to the Group of the benefits provided. To achieve this, investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets. The plans continue to invest a good proportion of the assets in equities, which the Group believes offer the best returns over the long term, commensurate with an acceptable level of risk. The plans expose the Group to a number of actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and, in certain markets, inflation risk. There are no unusual entity or	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id704: rate risk, longevity risk and, in certain markets, inflation risk. There are no unusual entity or plan-specific risks to the Group. For risk control, the pension funds also have significant investments in liability matching assets (bonds) as well as in property and other alternative assets; additionally, the Group uses derivatives to further mitigate the impact of the risks outlined above. The majority of assets are managed by a number of external fund managers with a small proportion managed in-house. Unilever has a pooled investment vehicle (Univest) which it believes offers its pension plans around the world a simplified externally managed investment vehicle to implement their strategic asset allocation models, currently for bonds, equities and alternative assets. The aim is to provide high-quality, well diversified, cost-effective, risk-controlled vehicles. The pension plans’ investments are overseen by Unilever’s internal investment company, the Univest Company.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id705: AssumptionsWith the objective of presenting the assets and liabilities of the pensions and other post-employment benefit plans at their fair value on the balance sheet, assumptions under IAS 19 are set by reference to market conditions at the valuation date. The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities vary according to the country in which the plan is situated.

Pdf_Chunk_id735: Unilever is subject to taxation in the many countries in which it operates. The tax legislation of these countries differs, is often complex and is subject to interpretation by management and the government authorities. These matters of judgement give rise to the need to create provisions for tax payments that may arise in future years with respect to transactions already undertaken. Provisions are made against individual exposures and take into account the specific circumstances of each case, including the strength of technical arguments, recent case law decisions or rulings on similar issues and relevant external advice. The provision is estimated based on one of two methods, the expected value method (the sum of the probability weighted amounts in a range of possible outcomes) or the single most likely amount method, depending on which is expected to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty.€ million 2018 (Restated)(a)€ million 2017 (Restated)(a)€ million 2019	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id739: Our tax rate is reduced by incentive tax credits, the benefit from preferential tax regimes that have been legislated by the countries and provinces concerned in order to promote economic development and investment. The tax rate is increased by business expenses which are not deductible for tax, such as entertainment costs and some interest expense and by irrecoverable withholding taxes on dividends paid by subsidiary companies and on other cross-border payments such as royalties and service fees, which cannot be offset against other taxes due. Uncertain tax provisions including the related interest and penalties amounted to €787 million (2018: €716 million).

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of unused tax losses of €4,272 million (2018: €4,914 million) and tax credits of €497 million (2018: €570 million), as it is not probable that there will be future taxable profits within the entities against which the losses can be utilised. Of these losses €4,108 million (2018: €4,752 million) have expiry dates, the majority being corporate income tax losses in the Netherlands which expire between now and 2026.Other deductible temporary differences of €48 million (2018: €48 million) have not been recognised as a deferred tax asset. There is no expiry date for these differences.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id746: At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was €2,476 million (2018: €2,681 million). No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.

Combined earnings per shareThe combined earnings per share calculations are based on the average number of share units representing the combined ordinary shares of NV and PLC in issue during the period, less the average number of shares held as treasury shares.In calculating diluted earnings per share and underlying earnings per share, a number of adjustments are made to the number of shares, principally, the exercise of share options by employees.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id750: Underlying earnings per share is calculated as underlying profit attributable to shareholders’ equity divided by the diluted combined average number of share units. In calculating underlying profit attributable to shareholders’ equity, net profit attributable to shareholders’ equity is adjusted to eliminate the post-tax impact of non-underlying items in operating profit and any other significant unusual items within net profit but not operating profit.Earnings per share for total operations for the 12 months were as follows:€ 2018 (Restated)(a)€ 2017 (Restated)(a)€ 2019Basic earnings per share3.492.152.15Diluted earnings per share3.482.142.14Underlying earnings per share2.352.232.55Millions of share unitsCalculation of average number of share units201820172019Average number of shares: NV1,714.71,714.71,598.0PLC1,264.01,310.21,175.5Less treasury shares held by employee share trusts and companies(295.4)(223.3)(157.0)	PDF

Goodwill and intangible assetsGoodwillGoodwill is initially recognised based on the accounting policy for business combinations (see note 21). Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less amounts provided for impairment.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id754: Goodwill acquired in a business combination is assessed to determine whether new cash generating units are created, and if not, is allocated to the Group’s CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. These might not always be the same as the CGUs that include the assets and liabilities of the acquired business. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, and is not larger than an operating segment.In 2019, the existing nine cash generating units (CGUs) based on the three geographical areas and three divisions are supplemented by a new health and well being CGU which is made up of recently acquired OLLY Nutrition business.Intangible assets	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id755: Intangible assetsSeparately purchased intangible assets are initially measured at cost, being the purchase price as at the date of acquisition. On acquisition of new interests in group companies, Unilever recognises any specifically identifiable intangible assets separately from goodwill. These intangible assets are initially measured at fair value as at the date of acquisition.Expenditure to support development of internally-produced intangible assets is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id756: Indefinite-life intangibles mainly comprise trademarks and brands, for which there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which they are expected to generate net cash inflows. These are considered to have an indefinite life, given the strength and durability of our brands and the level of marketing support. These assets are not amortised but are subject to a review for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate this is necessary. Any impairment is charged to the income statement as it arises.Finite-life intangible assets mainly comprise software, patented and non-patented technology, know-how and customer lists. These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis in the income statement over the period of their expected useful lives, or the period of legal rights if shorter. None of the amortisation periods exceeds ten years.108Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019Financial Statements9. Goodwill and intangible assets continued	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id764: Value in use has been calculated as the present value of projected cash flows. •The projections cover a period of five years, as we believe this to be the most appropriate timescale over which to review and consider annual performances before applying a fixed terminal value multiple to the final year cash flows. The growth rates and margins used to estimate future performance are based on the conservative end of the range of estimates from past performance, our annual forecast and three year strategic plan extended to year four and five. The long-term sustainable growth rates are determined as the lower of our three-year average market growth projection and World Bank’s three-year average GDP growth forecast for our markets. A pre-tax discount rate of 7.4% (2018: 7.4%) was used. The discount rate was based on the weighted average cost of capital of the Group, adjusted with a risk-premium.	PDF

Property, plant and equipmentThe Group’s property, plant and equipment is comprised of owned assets (note 10A) and leased assets (note 10B). Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost including eligible borrowing costs less depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.Property, plant and equipment is subject to review for impairment if triggering events or circumstances indicate that this is necessary. If an indication of impairment exists, the asset’s or cash generating unit’s recoverable amount is estimated and any impairment loss is charged to the income statement as it arises.Owned assets	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id766: Owned assetsOwned assets are initially measured at historical cost. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the expected average useful lives of the assets. Residual values are reviewed at least annually. Estimated useful lives by major class of assets are as follows: • Freehold buildings (no depreciation on freehold land) • Leasehold land and buildings • Plant and equipment40 years 40 years (or life of lease if less) 2–20 yearsLeased assetsThe cost of a leased asset is measured as the lease liability at inception of the lease contract and other direct costs less any incentives granted by the lessor. The Group has not capitalised leases which are less than 12 months or leases of low value assets. These mainly relate to IT equipment, office equipment, furniture and fitting and other peripheral items. When a lease liability is remeasured, the related lease asset is adjusted by the same amount.

The Group’s share of the profit or loss after tax of joint ventures and associates is included in the Group’s consolidated profit before taxation.Where the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in the equity accounted investee, the carrying amount of the investment is reduced to zero and the recognition of further losses is discontinued, except to the extent that the Group has an obligation to make payments on behalf of the investee.Biological assets are measured at fair value less costs to sell with any changes recognised in the income statement.€ million 2018 Restated(a)€ million 2019Interest in net assets of joint ventures1435Interest in net assets of associates4037Long-term trade and other receivables(b)307380	PDF

During 2019 a total expense of €363 million (2018: €227 million) was recognised in the income statement for inventory write downs and losses.13. Trade and other current receivablesTrade and other current receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently these assets are held at amortised cost, using the effective interest method and net of any impairment losses. Discounts payable to customers are shown as a reduction in trade receivables when there is a legal right and intent to settle them on a net basis.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id778: We do not consider the fair values of trade and other current receivables to be significantly different from their carrying values. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited, due to the Group’s customer base being large and diverse. Our historical experience of collecting receivables, supported by the level of default, is that credit risk is low across territories and so trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial assets. Impairment for trade receivables are calculated for specific receivables with known or anticipated issues affecting the likelihood of recovery and for balances past due with a probability of default based on historical data as well as relevant forward-looking information.€ million 2018 Restated(a)€ million 2019Trade and other current receivablesDue within one year4,3504,916Trade receivables(b)690579Prepayments and accrued income1,4421,200Other receivables6,4826,695	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id782: Financial Statements14. Trade payables and other liabilitiesTrade payables Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. Trade payables are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.Other liabilities Other liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent measurement depends on the type of liability: • Accruals are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method. • Social security and sundry taxes are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method. • Deferred consideration is subsequently measured at fair value with changes in the income statement as explained below. •Others are subsequently measured either at amortised cost, using the effective interest method or at fair value, with changes being recognised in the income statement.Deferred Consideration	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id783: Deferred ConsiderationDeferred consideration represents any payments to the sellers of a business that occur after the acquisition date. These typically comprise contingent consideration and fixed deferred consideration: • Fixed deferred consideration is a payment with a due date after acquisition that is not dependent on future conditions. • Contingent consideration is a payment which is dependent on certain conditions being met in the future and is often variable.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id784: All deferred consideration is initially recognised at fair value as at the acquisition date, which includes a present value discount. Subsequently, deferred consideration is measured to reflect the unwinding of discount on the liability, with changes recognised in finance cost within the income statement. In the balance sheet it is remeasured to reflect the latest estimate of the achievement of the conditions on which the consideration is based; changes in value other than the discount unwind are recognised as acquisition and disposal-related costs within non-underlying items in the income statement.We do not consider the fair values of trade payables and other liabilities to be significantly different from their carrying values.€ million 2018€ million 2019Trade payables and other liabilitiesCurrent: due within one yearTrade payables(a)9,1219,190Accruals3,7244,153Social security and sundry taxes498507Deferred consideration14391,100879Others	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id786: Included within others are IT and consulting services.Deferred ConsiderationAt 31 December 2019 the total balance of deferred consideration for acquisition is €208 million (2018: €187 million), which includes contingent consideration of €154 million (2018: €142 million). These contingent consideration payments are dependent on acquired businesses achieving contractually agreed financial targets (mainly relates to cumulative increases in turnover and profit before tax) and fall due up until 2024, with a maximum contractual amount of €1,140 million.Supplier financing arrangements for trade payables	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id787: Supplier financing arrangements for trade payablesSome of our suppliers elect to factor some of their receivables from the Group with financial institutions. In some instances we provide suppliers and/or banks with visibility of invoices approved for payment, which helps them receive cash from the bank before the invoice due date, if they choose to do so. Payment dates and terms for Unilever do not vary based on whether the supplier chooses to factor their receivable. If a receivable is purchased by a third party bank, that third party bank does not benefit from additional security when compared to the security originally enjoyed by the supplier. The Group evaluates these arrangements to assess if the payable holds the characteristics of a trade payable or should be classified as a financial liability. At 31 December 2019 and 31 December 2018 all such liabilities were classified as trade payables.115Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id788: 115Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Unilever Group continued15. Capital and fundingOrdinary shares Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.Internal holdings The ordinary shares numbered 1 to 2,400 (inclusive) in NV (‘Special Shares’) and deferred stock of PLC are held as to one half of each class by N.V. Elma – a subsidiary of NV – and one half by United Holdings Limited – a subsidiary of PLC. This capital is eliminated on consolidation.Share-based compensation The Group operates a number of share-based compensation plans involving options and awards of ordinary shares of NV and PLC. Full details of these plans are given in note 4C on pages 103 to 104.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id789: Other reserves Other reserves include the fair value reserve, the foreign currency translation reserve, the capital redemption reserve and treasury shares.Shares held by employee share trusts and group companies Certain PLC trusts, NV and group companies purchase and hold NV and PLC shares to satisfy performance shares granted, share options granted and other share awards (see note 4C). The assets and liabilities of these trusts and shares held by group companies are included in the consolidated financial statements. The book value of shares held is deducted from other reserves, and trusts’ borrowings are included in the Group’s liabilities. The costs of the trusts are included in the results of the Group. These shares are excluded from the calculation of earnings per share.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id790: Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value, less any directly related transaction costs. When bonds are designated as being part of a fair value hedge relationship in those cases bonds are carried at amortised cost, adjusted for the fair value of the risk being hedged, with changes in value shown in profit and loss. Other financial liabilities, excluding derivatives, are subsequently carried at amortised cost, with the exception of: • financial liabilities which the Group has elected to measure at fair value through profit or loss; • derivative financial liabilities – see note 16 on page 121; and •contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination to which IFRS 3 applies. Such contingent consideration is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id791: Lease liabilities Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not yet paid at the start of the lease term. This is discounted using an appropriate borrowing rate determined by the Group, where none is readily available in the lease contract.The lease liability is subsequently reduced by cash payments and increased by interest costs. The lease liability is remeasured when the Group assesses that there will be a change in the amount expected to be paid during the lease term.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id792: The Group’s Treasury activities are designed to: • maintain a competitive balance sheet in line with at least A/A2 rating (see below); • secure funding at lowest costs for the Group’s operations, M&A activity and external dividend payments (see below); • protect the Group’s financial results and position from financial risks (see note 16); • maintain market risks within acceptable parameters, while optimising returns (see note 16); and • protect the Group’s financial investments, while maximising returns (see note 17)	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id793: The Treasury department provides central deposit taking, funding and foreign exchange management services for the Group’s operations. The department is governed by standards and processes which are approved by Unilever Leadership Executive (ULE). In addition to guidelines and exposure limits, a system of authorities and extensive independent reporting covers all major areas of activity. Performance is monitored closely by senior management. Reviews are undertaken periodically by corporate audit.Key instruments used by the treasury department are: • short-term and long-term borrowings; • cash and cash equivalents; and • plain vanilla derivatives, including cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts.The Treasury department maintains a list of approved financial instruments. The use of any new instrument must be approved by the Chief Financial Officer. The use of leveraged instruments is not permitted.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id794: Unilever considers the following components of its balance sheet to be managed capital: • total equity – retained profit, other reserves, share capital, share premium, non-controlling interests (notes 15A and 15B); • short-term debt – current financial liabilities (note 15C); and • long-term debt – non-current financial liabilities (note 15C).The Group manages its capital so as to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to optimise returns to our shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity. The capital structure of the Group is based on management’s judgement of the appropriate balance of key elements in order to meet its strategic and day-to-day needs. We consider the amount of capital in proportion to risk and manage the capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id795: Our current long-term credit rating is A+/A1 and our short-term credit rating is A1/P1. We aim to maintain a competitive balance sheet which we consider to be the equivalent of a credit rating of at least A/A2 in the long term. This provides us with: • appropriate access to the debt and equity markets; • sufficient flexibility for acquisitions; • sufficient resilience against economic and financial uncertainty while ensuring ample liquidity; and • optimal weighted average cost of capital, given the above constraints.Unilever monitors the qualitative and quantitative factors utilised by the rating agencies. This information is publicly available and is updated by the credit rating agencies on a regular basis.116Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019Financial Statements15.

Treasury risk managementDerivatives and hedge accounting Derivatives are measured at fair value with any related transaction costs expensed as incurred. The treatment of changes in the value of derivatives depends on their use as explained below.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id812: (i) Fair value hedges(a) Certain derivatives are held to hedge the risk of changes in value of a specific bond or other loan. In these situations, the Group designates the liability and related derivative to be part of a fair value hedge relationship. The carrying value of the bond is adjusted by the fair value of the risk being hedged, with changes going to the income statement. Gains and losses on the corresponding derivative are also recognised in the income statement. The amounts recognised are offset in the income statement to the extent that the hedge is effective. Ineffectiveness may occur if the critical terms do not exactly match, or if there is a value adjustment resulting from a change in credit risk (in either the Group or the counter-party to the derivative) that is not matched by the hedged item. When the relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the fair value hedge adjustment made to the bond is amortised to the income statement using the	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id813: the fair value hedge adjustment made to the bond is amortised to the income statement using the effective interest method.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id814: (ii) Cash flow hedges(a) Derivatives are also held to hedge the uncertainty in timing or amount of future forecast cash flows. Such derivatives are classified as being part of cash flow hedge relationships. For an effective hedge, gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in equity. Cost of hedging, where material and opted for, is recorded in a separate account within equity. Any ineffective elements of the hedge are recognised in the income statement. Ineffectiveness may occur if there are changes to the expected timing of the hedged transaction. If the hedged cash flow relates to a non-financial asset, the amount accumulated in equity is subsequently included within the carrying value of that asset. For other cash flow hedges, amounts deferred in equity are taken to the income statement at the same time as the related cash flow.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id815: When a derivative no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss remains in equity until the related cash flow occurs. When the cash flow takes place, the cumulative gain or loss is taken to the income statement. If the hedged cash flow is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss is taken to the income statement immediately.(iii) Net investment hedges(a) Certain derivatives are designated as hedges of the currency risk on the Group’s investment in foreign subsidiaries. The accounting policy for these arrangements is set out in note 1.(iv) Derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied Derivatives not classified as hedges are held in order to hedge certain balance sheet items and commodity exposures. No hedge accounting is applied to these derivatives, which are carried at fair value with changes being recognised in the income statement.(a)	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id816: (a)Applying hedge accounting has not led to material ineffectiveness being recognised in the income statement for both 2019 and 2018. Fair value changes on basis spread is recorded in a separate account within equity.The Group is exposed to the following risks that arise from its use of financial instruments, the management of which is described in the following sections: • liquidity risk (see note 16A); • market risk (see note 16B); and • credit risk (see note 17B).The group's risk management policies are established to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to maintain adherence to these limits. These policies are in line with Unilever's risk management framework.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id817: 16A. Management of liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will face in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities when due without incurring unacceptable losses. In doing this, management considers both normal and stressed conditions. A material and sustained shortfall in our cash flow could undermine the Group’s credit rating, impair investor confidence and also restrict the Group’s ability to raise funds.The Group maintained a cautious funding strategy. This was the result of cash delivery from the business, coupled with the proceeds from bond issuances. This cash has been invested conservatively with low risk counter-parties at maturities of less than six months.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id818: Cash flow from operating activities provides the funds to service the financing of financial liabilities on a day-to-day basis. The Group seeks to manage its liquidity requirements by maintaining access to global debt markets through short-term and long-term debt programmes. In addition, Unilever has committed credit facilities for general corporate use.On 31 December 2019 Unilever had undrawn revolving 364-day bilateral credit facilities in aggregate of $7,865 million (2018: $7,865 million) with a 364- day term out.

Management of market risk Unilever’s size and operations result in it being exposed to the following market risks that arise from its use of financial instruments: • commodity price risk; • currency risk; and interest rate risk. •The above risks may affect the Group’s income and expenses, or the value of its financial instruments. The objective of the Group’s management of market risk is to maintain this risk within acceptable parameters, while optimising returns. Generally, the Group applies hedge accounting to manage the volatility in profit and loss arising from market risk.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id825: Where the Group uses hedge accounting to mitigate the above risks, it is normally implemented centrally by either the Treasury or Commodity Risk Management teams, in line with their respective frameworks and strategies. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship continues to exist between the hedged item and hedging instrument. The Group generally enters into hedge relationships where the critical terms of the hedging instrument match exactly with the hedged item, meaning that the economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument is evident, so only a qualitative assessment is performed. When a qualitative assessment is not considered sufficient, for example when the critical terms of the hedging instrument do not match exactly with the hedged item, a quantitative assessment of hedge effectiveness will also be performed. The hedge	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id826: the hedged item, a quantitative assessment of hedge effectiveness will also be performed. The hedge ratio is set on inception for all hedge relationships and is dependent on the alignment of the critical terms of the hedging instrument to the hedged item (in most instances these are matched, so the hedge ratio is 1:1).

Pdf_Chunk_id827: The Group’s exposure to, and management of, these risks is explained below. It often includes derivative financial instruments, the uses of which are described in note 16C.Management policy and hedging strategyPotential impact of riskSensitivity to the riskA 10% increase in commodity prices as at 31 December 2019 would have led to a €56 million gain on the commodity derivatives in the cash flow hedge reserve (2018: €51 million gain in the cash flow hedge reserve).(i) Commodity price riskThe Group uses commodity forwards, futures, swaps and option contracts to hedge against this risk. All commodity forward contracts hedge future purchases of raw materials and the contracts are settled either in cash or by physical delivery.The Group is exposed to the risk of changes in commodity prices in relation to its purchase of certain raw materials.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id828: At 31 December 2019, the Group had hedged its exposure to future commodity purchases with commodity derivatives valued at €439 million (2018: €580 million).A decrease of 10% in commodity prices on a full- year basis would have the equal but opposite effect.The Group also hedges risk, components of commodities where it is not possible to hedge the commodity in full. This is done with reference to the contract to purchase the hedged commodity.Hedges of future commodity purchases resulted in cumulative losses of €52 million (2018: losses of €25 million ) being reclassified to the income statement and losses of €28 million (2018: losses of €24 million) being recognised as a basis adjustment to inventory purchased.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id829: Commodity derivatives are generally designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge accounting relations. All commodity derivative contracts are done in line with approvals from the Global Commodity Executive which is chaired by the Unilever Chief Supply Chain Officer (CSCO) or the Global Commodity Operating Team which is chaired by the Chief Procurement Officer.123Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Unilever Group continued16B.

This aim has been achieved in all years presented.A 10% strengthening of the foreign currencies against the respective functional currencies of group companies would have led to approximately an additional €32 million gain in the income statement (2018 restated for IFRS 16: €30 million gain).The Group manages the foreign currency risk by hedging forecasted sales and purchase transactions that are expected to occur within a maximum 12-month period through layered hedging.

Pdf_Chunk_id831: A 10% weakening of the foreign currencies against the respctive functional currencies of group companies would have led to an equal but opposite effect.At 31 December 2019, the exposure to the Group from companies holding financial assets and liabilities other than in their functional currency amounted to €317 million (2018 restated for IFRS 16: €298 million).As at year end, the Group had the below notional amount of currency derivatives outstanding to which cash flow hedge accounting is applied:Unilever aims to minimise this currency risk on the Group's net investment exposure by borrowing in local currency in the operating companies themselves. In some locations, however, the Group’s ability to do this is inhibited by local regulations, lack of local liquidity or by local market conditions.Currency risk on the Group’s net investments	PDF

In accordance with IAS 21, the exchange differences on these financial loans are booked through reserves.Where the residual risk from these countries exceeds prescribed limits, Treasury may decide on a case-by-case basis to actively hedge the exposure. This is done either through additional borrowings in the related currency, or through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.USD538640SEK(136)(94)CAD(126)(108)PLN(104)(67)	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id836: Impact on income statementAssuming that all other variables remain constant, a 1.0 percentage point increase in floating interest rates on a full-year basis as at 31 December 2019 would have led to an additional €37 million of finance cost (2018: €33 million additional finance costs).The Group is exposed to market interest rate fluctuations on its floating rate debt. Increases in benchmark interest rates could increase the interest cost of our floating-rate debt and increase the cost of future borrowings. The Group’s ability to manage interest costs also has an impact on reported results.This is achieved either by issuing fixed or floating-rate long-term debt, or by modifying interest rate exposure through the use of interest rate swaps.A 1.0 percentage point decrease in floating interest rates on a full-year basis would have an equal but opposite effect.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id837: The Group does not have any material floating interest bearing financial assets or any significant long-term fixed interest bearing financial assets. Consequently the Group's interest rate risk arises mainly from financial liabilities other than lease liabilities.The majortiy of the Group's existing interest rate derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and are expected to be effective. The fair value movement of these derivatives is recognised in the income statement, along with any changes in the relevant fair value of the underlying hedged asset or liability.Impact on equity – cash flow hedgesAssuming that all other variables remain constant, a 1.0 percentage point increase in interest rates on a full-year basis as at 31 December 2019 would have led to an additional €8 million credit in equity from derivatives in cash flow hedge relationships (2018: €17 million credit).

Pdf_Chunk_id843: Financial StatementsMaster netting or similar agreementsA number of legal entities within our Group enter into derivative transactions under International Swap and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements. In general, under such agreements the amounts owed by each counter-party on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same currency are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other. In certain circumstances, such as when a credit event such as a default occurs, all outstanding transactions under the agreement are terminated, the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable in settlement of all transactions.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id844: The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting the positive and negative values in the consolidated balance sheet. This is because the Group does not have any currently legally enforceable right to offset recognised amounts, between various Group and bank affiliates, because the right to offset is enforceable only on the occurrence of future credit events such as a default.The column ‘Related amounts not set off in the balance sheet – Financial instruments’ shows the netting impact of our ISDA agreements, assuming the agreements are respected in the relevant jurisdiction.(i) Financial assetsThe following financial assets are subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements.Related amounts not set off in the balance sheet€ million Gross amounts of recognised financial assets set off in the balance sheet€ million€ million€ million€ million€ millionNet amounts of financial assets presented in the balance sheet	PDF

Investment and returnCash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet include deposits, investments in money market funds and highly liquid investments. To be classified as cash and cash equivalents, an asset must: • be readily convertible into cash; • have an insignificant risk of changes in value; and • have a maturity period of typically three months or less at acquisition.Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement also include bank overdrafts and are recorded at amortised cost.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id847: Other financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets into the following measurement categories: • those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income, or through profit or loss), and • those to be measured at amortised cost.This classification depends on our business model for managing the financial asset and the contractual terms of the cash flows.At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id848: All financial assets are either debt instruments or equity instruments. Debt instruments are those that provide the Group with a contractual right to receive cash or another asset. Equity instruments are those where the Group has no contractual right to receive cash or another asset.Debt instrumentsThe subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Groups business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories that debt instruments are classified as: • financial assets at amortised cost; • financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income; or • financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.(i) Amortised cost	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id849: (i) Amortised costAssets measured at amortised cost are those which are held to collect contractual cash flows on the repayment of principal or interest (SPPI). A gain or loss on a debt investment recognised at amortised cost on de-recognition or impairment is recognised in profit or loss. Interest income is recognised within finance income using the effective interest rate method.(ii) Fair value through other comprehensive income	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id850: (ii) Fair value through other comprehensive incomeAssets that are held at fair value through other comprehensive income are those that are held to collect contractual cash flows on the repayment of principal and interest and which are held to recognise a capital gain through the sale of the asset. Movements in the carrying amount are recognised in other comprehensive income except for the recognition of impairment, interest income and foreign exchange gains or losses which are recognised in profit or loss. On de-recognition, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss. Interest income is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method.(iii) Fair value through profit or loss	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id851: (iii) Fair value through profit or lossAssets that do not meet the criteria for either amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income are measured as fair value through profit or loss. Related transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Unless they form part of a hedging relationship, these assets are held at fair value, with changes being recognised in the income statement. Interest income from these assets is included within finance income.Equity instrumentsThe Group subsequently measures all equity instruments at fair value. Where the Group has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in other comprehensive income, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains or losses to profit or loss. Dividends from these investments continue to be recognised in profit or loss.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id852: Impairment of financial assets Financial instruments classified as amortised cost and debt instruments classified as fair value through other comprehensive income are assessed for impairment. The Group assesses the probability of default of an asset at initial recognition and then whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis.To assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the asset as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. It considers available reasonable and supportive forwarding-looking information. Macroeconomic information (such as market interest rates or growth rates) is also considered.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id853: Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, such as a debtor failing to engage in a repayment plan with the company. Impairment losses on assets classified as amortised cost are recognised in profit or loss. When a later event causes the impairment losses to decrease, the reduction in impairment loss is also recognised in profit or loss. Permanent impairment losses on debt instruments classified as fair value through other comprehensive income are recognised in profit or loss.128Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019Financial Statements17.

Pdf_Chunk_id855: For the purposes of this note and note 15C, financial assets and liabilities exclude trade and other current receivables and trade payables and other liabilities which are covered in notes 13 and 14 respectively. Current financial assets at amortised cost include short-term deposits with banks with maturities longer than three months and loans to joint venture entities. Non- current financial assets at amortised cost include judicial deposit of €136 million (2018: €128 million) and investments in bonds of €56 million (2018: €93 million). Included within non-current financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are equity investments of €244 million (2018: €148 million). These investments are not held by Unilever for trading purposes and hence the Group has opted to recognise fair value movements through other comprehensive income.

These companies provide loans to our subsidiaries that are also funded through retained earnings and third party borrowings. We maintain access to global debt markets through an infrastructure of short and long-term debt programmes. We make use of plain vanilla derivatives, such as interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts, to help mitigate risks. More detail is provided in notes 16, 16A, 16B and 16C on pages 121 to 127.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id859: The remaining €3.2 billion (76%) of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents are held in foreign subsidiaries which repatriate distributable reserves on a regular basis. For most countries, this is done through dividends which are in some cases subject to withholding or distribution tax. This balance includes €146 million (2018: €154 million, 2017: €206 million) of cash that is held in a few countries where we face cross-border foreign exchange controls and/or other legal restrictions that inhibit our ability to make these balances available for general use by the wider business. The cash will generally be invested or held in the relevant country and, given the other capital resources available to the Group, does not significantly affect the ability of the Group to meet its cash obligations.129Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Unilever Group continued17.

Pdf_Chunk_id860: 17B. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counter-party fails to meet its contractual obligations. Additional information in relation to credit risk on trade receivables is given in note 13. These risks are generally managed by local controllers. Credit risk related to the use of treasury instruments, including those held at amortised cost and at fair value through other comprehensive income, is managed on a Group basis. This risk arises from transactions with financial institutions involving cash and cash equivalents, deposits and derivative financial instruments. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets. To reduce this risk, Unilever has concentrated its main activities with a limited number of counter-parties which have secure credit ratings. Individual risk limits are set for each counter-party based on financial position, credit rating and past experience.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id861: are set for each counter-party based on financial position, credit rating and past experience. Credit limits and concentration of exposures are actively monitored by the Group’s treasury department. Netting agreements are also put in place with Unilever’s principal counter-parties. In the case of a default, these arrangements would allow Unilever to net assets and liabilities across transactions with that counter-party. To further reduce the Group’s credit exposures on derivative financial instruments, Unilever has collateral agreements with Unilever’s principal counter-parties in relation to derivative financial instruments. Under these arrangements, counter-parties are required to deposit securities and/or cash as a collateral for their obligations in respect of derivative financial instruments. At 31 December 2019 the collateral held by Unilever under such arrangements amounted to €24 million (2018: €10 million), of which €24 million (2018: €10 million) was in cash, and €Nil	PDF

If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2. If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3. Derivatives are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counter-parties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying commodities.

These include potential future payments related to leases of low value assets, leases which are less than twelve months, variable leases, extension and termination options and leases not yet commenced but which we have committed to.Contingent liabilities are either possible obligations that will probably not require a transfer of economic benefits, or present obligations that may, but probably will not, require a transfer of economic benefits. It is not appropriate to make provisions for contingent liabilities, but there is a chance that they will result in an obligation in the future.

The majority of contingent liabilities are in respect of fiscal matters in Brazil.Assessing the amount of liabilities that are not probable is highly judgemental.

Pdf_Chunk_id880: Total contingent liabilities3,6584,210(a)During 2004, and in common with many other businesses operating in Brazil, one of our Brazilian subsidiaries received a notice of infringement from the Federal Revenue Service in respect of indirect taxes. The notice alleges that a 2001 reorganisation of our local corporate structure was undertaken without valid business purpose. The 2001 reorganisation was comparable with restructurings done by many companies in Brazil. The original dispute was resolved in the courts in the Group’s favour. However, in 2013 a new assessment was raised in respect of a similar matter. Additionally, during the course of 2014 and again in 2017, 2018 and 2019 other notices of infringement were issued based on the same grounds argued in the previous assessments. The total amount of the tax assessments in respect of this matter is €2,235 million (2018: €2,032 million). The judicial process in Brazil is likely to take a number of years to conclude.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id881: The Group believes that the likelihood that the Brazilian tax authorities will ultimately prevail is low, however there can be no guarantee of success in court. In each case we believe our position is strong so they have not been provided for and are considered to be contingent liabilities. Due to the fiscal environment in Brazil the possibility of further tax assessments related to the same matters cannot be ruled out. We expect that three of our largest tax litigation cases, which represent around €1.8 billion of contingent liabilities, will move from the Administrative to the Judicial Courts during 2020 although the timing is uncertain. When this happens, we will be required to make a judicial deposit or provide a guarantee in respect of the disputed tax, interest and penalties. The judicial process in Brazil is likely to take a number of years to conclude.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id882: The contingent liabilities reported for indirect taxes relating to disputes with the Brazilian authorities are separate from the provisions listed in note 19; Unilever does not have provision and contingent liabilities for the same matters.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id883: In 2019, a tax assessment was issued in connection with UK tax audit that commenced in 2015. The total amount of the tax assessment in respect of this matter is €141 million and is included in other contingent liabilities. The UK tax authorities are reviewing the allocation of taxable income related to intangible assets and centralised services as between Unilever N.V. and Unilever PLC, and whether Unilever N.V. has a permanent establishment in the UK. These arrangements have been in place and consistently applied by Unilever for many years and have been previously reviewed and accepted by the UK tax authorities. The period of review is for the years from 2011 to 2017, and the €141 million tax assessment is in respect of an alleged Unilever N.V. permanent establishment in the UK for 2015. Unilever strongly disagrees with the positions taken by the UK tax authorities and believes that the positions as filed in UK tax returns are in accordance with the tax legislation. Given the	PDF

Given the potential impact of any adjustment on the allocation of taxable income between Unilever N.V. and Unilever PLC, with potential consequential effects for Dutch taxable income, we have filed a protective Mutual Agreement Procedure with the Dutch and UK authorities.

Pdf_Chunk_id885: Discussions with the UK tax authorities are ongoing and there is recognition that significant further work is required before any further tax assessments can be issued and that the issues raised overlap in whole or part and therefore require a sequenced resolution. On the basis of the tax assessment issued the maximum exposure could be up to €600 million.133Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2019Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Unilever Group continued21.

Pdf_Chunk_id886: Goodwill is measured at the acquisition date as the fair value of consideration transferred, plus non-controlling interests and the fair value of any previously held equity interests less the net recognised amount (which is generally fair value) of the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is subject to an annual review for impairment (or more frequently if necessary) in accordance with our accounting policies. Any impairment is charged to the income statement as it arises. Detailed information relating to goodwill is provided in note 9 on pages 108 to 110.Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, within non-underlying items.Changes in ownership that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as equity transactions and therefore do not have any impact on goodwill. The difference between consideration and the non-controlling share of net assets acquired is recognised within equity.	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id1126: Raw materials Our products use a wide variety of raw and packaging materials which we source internationally and which may be subject to price volatility either directly or as a result of movements in foreign exchange rates.

Looking ahead to 2020, we remain watchful for volatility in commodity and foreign exchange markets.Seasonality Certain of our businesses, such as ice cream, are subject to significant seasonal fluctuations in sales. However, Unilever operates globally in many different markets and product categories, and no individual element of seasonality is likely to be material to the results of the Group as a whole.	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id1213: OUR PURPOSE UNILEVER’S PURPOSE IS TO MAKE SUSTAINABLE LIVING COMMONPLACE. WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO DELIVER LONG-TERM SUSTAINABLE GROWTH.Every day, 2.5 billion people use our products to feel good, look good and get more out of life. Our range of around 400 household brands includes Lipton, Knorr, Dove, Rexona, Hellmann’s and Omo. We are one of the largest fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies globally. In 2018 we had 12 brands with turnover of over a billion euros or more. The strength of our global brands is reflected in Kantar’s Brand Footprint report published in May 2018. It found that 13 of the world’s top 50 FMCG brands – based on market penetration and consumer interactions – are owned by Unilever with these brands chosen 36 billion times each year. This is significantly more than any other FMCG company in the study.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1214: We believe long-term sustainable growth is best delivered through brands that offer great performance and have a genuine purpose. Washing shirts whiter or making hair healthier and shinier is still vitally important, but product performance by itself is no longer enough. Consumers are looking for more.At Unilever, we encourage our brand managers to take a stance and make a positive difference to society. Purpose defines a brand in people's minds and is best delivered through action. It's only through action that consumers will see purpose as more than marketing.Our company purpose ‘To make sustainable living commonplace’ is unequivocal. We want to help create a world where everyone can live well within the natural limits of the planet. We put sustainable living at the heart of everything we do, including our brands and products, our standards of behaviour and our partnerships which drive transformational change across our value chain.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1215: Our portfolio also includes iconic local brands designed to meet the specific needs of consumers in their home market such as Brooke Bond in India and Brilhante in Brazil. We are increasingly seeing our local brands and innovations being rolled out to more markets such as Lakme and Breyers Delights. Our geographic reach gives us an unparalleled global presence, including a unique position in emerging markets which generate 58% of our turnover.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1216: Purpose takes many forms amongst our brands. Some, like Lifebuoy, take on life-threatening diseases associated with poor hygiene with programmes to change handwashing behaviour. Domestos' purpose is to improve sanitation for millions of people who do not have access to a toilet. Our brands can also be a catalyst to promote positive cultural norms. Brooke Bond's purpose 'Common ground is only a cup away' is highly relevant in an increasingly divided world and can be applied well locally. In India, it addresses religious tensions. In the Gulf, divorce. In Canada, same-sex relationships.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1217: From the beginning of 2018, Unilever began operating across three new Divisions created as part of our efforts to accelerate shareholder value creation. The largest by turnover is Beauty & Personal Care followed by Foods & Refreshment then Home Care. Details of each can be found on pages 11 to 12. The sale of our spreads business was also completed in mid-2018. These changes create a strong platform to accelerate our strategy of long-term, sustainable shareholder value creation. Our strategy is explained in detail on page 10.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1218: Some of our brands take an activist stance, mobilising citizens to change policy or create social movements. For example, Ben & Jerry's builds movements around issues such as climate change and the refugee crisis. Seventh Generation – with its plant-based products – campaigns for renewable energy. Deodorant brand Rexona's purpose is to help reverse physical inactivity, a big issue for societies facing increasingly sedentary lifestyles. Rexona believes 'the more you move, the more you live' supported by Motion Sense technology which works through movement. Radiant believes everyone deserves an opportunity to shine. It goes beyond bright clothes and helping consumers 'dress to progress', enhancing skills through its Career Academies. Each market focuses on the skills that matter locally. In Brazil that's entrepreneurial and business skills. In India, English language skills.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1219: Our business activities span a complex global value chain which is described on page 9. At the heart of our business is a workforce of 155,000 people (as at 31 December 2018) who are driven by our purpose and empowered to excel in our fast-changing markets. The combination of global scale and local agility has become yet more effective through the continued implementation of our Connected 4 Growth (C4G) change programme to meet consumer trends which are detailed on page 8. Our employees are supported by leadership teams with representatives from over 70 countries. Of our business leaders, 80% are local to their markets reflecting the deep local expertise at the heart of our business. This rises to more than 90% when we include managers who support those teams.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1220: In this volatile and uncertain world, protecting Unilever through the fostering of business integrity is a non-negotiable for all employees. Our Code of Business Principles (the Code), and the 24 policies that support it (Code Policies), set out the behaviour standards required from all our people. The Code Policies cover a number of areas, including anti-bribery and corruption, respect, dignity and fair treatment of people and personal data and privacy. Together, the Code and Code Policies help us put our values of Integrity, Respect, Responsibility and Pioneering into practice. See page 16 for more on our Code and Code Policies.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1221: All of Unilever's brands are on a journey to becoming purposeful. Sustainable Living brands are those that are furthest ahead. In 2017, 26 of our brands qualified as Sustainable Living brands including our B-Corp certified brands such as Ben & Jerry's, Seventh Generation and Pukka Herbs, which means that they meet high standards of social and environmental performance, transparency and legal accountability. Our Sustainable Living brands grew 46% faster than the rest of the business and delivered more than 70% of Unilever’s growth, driven by consumer demand for brands with purpose at their core.However volatile and uncertain the world is, Unilever’s purpose – supported by the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP) and brands with purpose – will remain steadfast because managing for the benefit of multiple stakeholders is the best way for us to grow.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1222: During the year the Boards withdrew proposals to simplify Unilever’s dual-headed legal structure after extensive engagement with shareholders. We remain firmly committed to our 2020 financial programme and are confident of meeting its key targets and objectives as our faster, simpler organisation delivers more efficiency, lower costs and significant operational and financial benefits.We are now looking beyond the current USLP as many of our targets end in 2020. We carried out an extensive listening exercise on the future of sustainable business. We spoke to approximately 300 stakeholders, including more than 130 external experts, and heard from over 40,000 employees through a ‘Have Your Say’ survey. They gave us their views on the priorities that they would like Unilever to focus on. The results will be used to co-create Unilever’s future agenda.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1223: This Annual Report and Accounts provides further detail on our performance during the year and how our business model is delivering strong returns for shareholders and a more sustainable way of doing business for the benefit of all our stakeholders. Find out more about our performance on pages 6 and 7.1Strategic ReportUnilever Annual Report and Accounts 2018CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENTAlan has led Unilever's largest Division, Beauty & Personal Care, for the last four years and he has been a member of the Group's Leadership Executive since 2011. His previous roles include running Unilever’s business in North Asia. Alan has deep understanding and wide experience of Unilever’s business and markets. He is a strong, dynamic and values-driven leader with an impressive track record of delivering consistent high-quality performance across both developed and emerging markets. The Boards warmly welcome Alan to the role and look forward to working closely with him in the years ahead.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1224: 2018 PERFORMANCE I am pleased to report that 2018 was another year of consistent top and bottom line performance for Unilever. Solid revenue growth was combined with good profitability and cash flow delivery. This despite a challenging year for the global economy, with subdued growth and high levels of volatility undermining consumer confidence in many parts of the world.Unilever is also operating in a sector that is experiencing widespread change and disruption. Although challenging, these changes offer significant opportunities to companies able to move with speed and agility and who can tailor their offering to changing consumer preferences. To that end, the Boards are very confident that Unilever's strategy and the measures it has taken to strengthen its organisation, sharpen its portfolio and digitise its operations make it well placed to capture new and emerging growth opportunities.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1225: Unilever has been transformed under the leadership of Paul Polman. He has overseen ten years of consistent top and bottom line growth and very competitive returns to shareholders. He leaves with the company’s geographic footprint and brand portfolio stronger and well positioned for future growth.Paul’s pioneering commitment to sustainable and equitable growth have marked him – and the company – out as leaders in the field. Thanks to his visionary leadership and tireless efforts, Unilever is not only one of the most admired and respected companies in the world today, but also one of the most desired employers.The Boards also believe that the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan continues to set Unilever apart as a business highly attuned to the growing desire among consumers for companies and brands that serve a wider societal and environmental need.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1226: Paul retired as CEO and as a Board member on 31 December 2018. He will support the transition process in the first half of 2019 and will leave the Group in early July. We thank him for his remarkable contribution to the company and wish him every success in the future.In 2018 we also completed successfully the complex disposal of the spreads business. Our Share Buy-back programme delivered on its intention to buy back shares with an aggregate market value of €6 billion, in line with Unilever's objective to return the after-tax proceeds of the spreads disposal to shareholders.REMUNERATION During 2018 we also continued to consult with shareholders on our Remuneration Policy, particularly for the Executive Directors. At the 2017 AGMs you provided your strong support to the implementation of a reward framework that encourages and enhances a strong performance culture by enabling Unilever managers to have an even stronger personal commitment to Unilever share ownership.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1227: SIMPLIFICATION Following a thorough review and widespread consultation, the Boards put forward proposals in 2018 to simplify Unilever’s dual-headed structure under a new single holding company.In developing the proposal – including a recommendation to incorporate in the Netherlands while maintaining listings in the Netherlands, the UK and the US – the Boards were motivated by the opportunity to unlock value by simplifying Unilever and giving it added flexibility to compete effectively over the longer-term.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1228: At the 2018 AGMs, we asked shareholders to approve a new Remuneration Policy that would align the pay of our Executive Directors fully with the Reward Framework we introduced following the 2017 AGMs. Whilst shareholders approved the new Remuneration Policy, we recognised that a significant minority of NV and PLC shareholders voted against the proposal. On pages 50 and 51 of the 2018 Directors' Remuneration Report, we describe in detail the principal concerns and how we responded to them and other changes to the implementation of the Remuneration Policy.We recognised however that the proposal did not receive support from a significant group of shareholders and therefore considered it appropriate to withdraw. The Boards still believe that simplifying Unilever’s dual-headed structure would, over time, provide opportunities to further accelerate value creation and would serve Unilever’s best long-term interests.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1229: EVALUATION Following the external Board evaluation in 2017, we used a simplified internal evaluation this year. While we concluded that the Boards continued to operate in an effective manner overall, the Boards decided that it will maintain a particular focus on portfolio and channel strategies and digitisation. Each Board Committee also performed its own self-evaluation, agreeing areas where it could enhance its effectiveness further. These are described within each Committee Report.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1230: Since withdrawing the proposal, I have met with a significant number of PLC and NV shareholders to discuss further ideas and possible next steps. It is clear from all these meetings that there is widespread support for the principles and strategic rationale behind Simplification. In these meetings, I also took the opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to further strengthen our corporate governance. Accordingly, in February 2019, we followed through on our commitment to cancel the NV Preference Shares, in itself a major step towards simplifying the company’s share capital.LOOKING AHEAD Even though trading conditions are likely to remain challenging in 2019, the Boards remain confident both in the outlook and in the strategy for the Group, reflected by an 8% increase in the dividend for the 2018 financial year.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1231: BOARD COMPOSITION AND SUCCESSION The 2018 AGMs marked the retirement of Ann Fudge as a Non-Executive Director and Vice-Chairman of the Boards. On behalf of the Boards, I would like to thank Ann for her outstanding and valued contribution to Unilever.Over the year, Board members have visited Unilever operations in several parts of the world, including China and the United States. We have seen first-hand the depth of talent that exists within the company, as well as the commitment of Unilever people to go on improving the lives of consumers and the societies in which the company operates. On behalf of the Boards, I want to thank all of the 155,000 employees of Unilever for their remarkable efforts.I was also delighted that you elected Andrea Jung as a Non-Executive Director at the same AGMs. Andrea brings highly relevant experience and expertise to Unilever and is a very welcome addition to the Boards.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1232: CEO SUCCESSION A key focus for the Boards last year was to manage the CEO succession, with Paul Polman stepping down as CEO after 10 years with the Group.Equally we have been pleased to engage with many of the company’s other stakeholders, without whom Unilever could not be successful. That includes our shareholders, who I also want to thank for their continued support of the company.After a rigorous and wide-ranging selection process, the Boards were unanimous in its decision to appoint Alan Jope to the role. Alan became CEO on 1 January 2019 and is being proposed as an Executive Director at the 2019 AGMs.MARIJN DEKKERS CHAIRMAN2Strategic ReportUnilever Annual Report and Accounts 2018BOARD OF DIRECTORSOVERVIEW OF EXECUTIVE & NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORSMARIJN DEKKERS Chairman	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id1241: 3Strategic ReportUnilever Annual Report and Accounts 2018CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEWWidespread economic and geopolitical uncertainty meant that the global business environment remained challenging in 2018. Currency depreciation in a number of key markets fuelled inflationary pressures and dampened consumer demand, while input costs rose steadily on the back of escalating commodity prices.new and faster-growing channels. Our e-commerce sales were up by 47%, ahead of global e-commerce market growth and putting us well on the road to building a scale e-commerce business. We also accelerated the growth of our business with Discounters, in the Health and Beauty channel and in the out-of-home eating market.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1242: The digital transformation of the company also continues apace. We are working successfully with leading global technology companies to build world-class technology and data analytics infrastructure. Through the sophisticated and responsible leveraging of our data insights, we are close to reaching our goal of being able to connect directly with a billion of our consumers. In our operations, we have already automated over 700 processes – saving time and reducing cost – and our in-house training programmes are increasingly focussed on the digital up-skilling of our own people.A SOLID PERFORMANCE Against this backdrop, Unilever delivered a solid performance. Underlying sales grew by 3.1%, excluding the recently-divested spreads business (2.9% including spreads). Growth was profitable, bringing our underlying operating margin to 18.4%, up 90 basis points, which also drove a healthy free cash flow of €5 billion for the year.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1243: Importantly, the overall shape and quality of the performance was encouraging. We achieved a good balance of price and volume growth. Growth was broad-based, across each of our three global Divisions – Beauty & Personal Care, Home Care and Foods & Refreshment. Our continuing margin progression was underpinned by well-embedded savings and efficiency programmes, and an improving mix from underlying sales growth in Beauty & Personal Care.Our attractiveness as an employer of choice grew still further in2018. Unilever is now the number one FMCG graduate employer of choice in almost 50 countries. That is a remarkable achievement, and testament to Unilever’s values and commitment to be a force for good in the world.Inspired by the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan, we also saw our brands with the most distinct and well-articulated social and environmental purpose grow significantly faster than our other brands.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1244: Strengthened by these measures, we are good in shape for the future. We ended 2018 with 58% of our turnover in the emerging markets and enjoying number 1 or 2 positions in 85% of the key markets and categories in which we compete. Our Beauty & Personal Care business – where some of the biggest growth opportunities exist – now represents 40% of our turnover. All of this makes us well placed to capture the many opportunities that exist across our markets.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1245: The performance last year demonstrates I believe that our strategy is working. By empowering our three global Divisions, we are allowing for more strategic allocation of resource and for greater differentiation in meeting changing consumer needs. Beauty & Personal Care, for example, made good progress in moving to more premium positions and expanding in the high growth segments. Home Care built on its already strong emerging market footprint with a strategy of market development and benefit-led innovation for emerging needs. Whilst Foods & Refreshment was combined into a single division bringing more scale and focus to allow faster transformation of our portfolio.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1246: LOOKING AHEAD Building on these strong foundations, I have already made clear that my first priority as CEO will be to accelerate quality growth. For us, that means an investment-led approach based on delivering our 4G growth model – consistent growth, competitive growth, profitable growth and responsible growth, with an equal focus on each.The results in 2018 re-affirm the enduring strength of Unilever’s brands and the growing resilience of our organisational model, as well as underlining Unilever’s ability to deliver consistent top and bottom line performance even in very challenging conditions. Nevertheless, we are determined to step up the proportion of our business that is winning market share as part of moving our sales growth more consistently into the middle of our multi-year 3-5% targeted range.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1247: In particular, I want to leave no doubt that I intend to build further on Unilever’s century-old commitment to responsible business. 'Making Sustainable Living Commonplace' will remain our purpose as a company and we will use this to keep Unilever at the forefront of ensuring business is a force for good. More and more of our brands will become explicit about the positive social and environmental impact they have. This is entirely aligned to the instincts of our people and to the expectations of our consumers. It is not about putting purpose ahead of profits, it is purpose that drives profits.A YEAR OF PROGRESS As well as delivering a solid set of results, we also made good progress in 2018 in strengthening the overall business to be ready for future opportunities:	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1248: Despite the progress we have made in recent years, I am also clear that – in a world where the speed of change is relentless – we need to quicken the pace of everything we do still further. I want to make speed and skills for a digital age a hallmark of Unilever under my leadership.By empowering those closest to the marketplace, and by linkingour global brand teams across the world, our Connected for Growth (C4G) organisational model is helping to increase speed and agility, as well as giving rise to a greater entrepreneurial spirit inside the company. As an illustration of this, time to market with new innovations to meet local trends is now 40%-50% faster compared to 2016. We also launched 19 new brands, including Love Home and Planet, a range of plant-based, home-cleaning products and a follow-up to our successful launch of the natural and sustainable hair and skincare product range, Love Beauty and Planet.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1249: If we can do all this then I am confident we can achieve our strategic aims and deliver many years of solid cash flow, further underlying operating margin improvement and good quality growth.AND FINALLY… I want to thank my colleagues throughout the whole company for their hard work in delivering these results. Unilever is fortunate to have such talented and dedicated people and I am deeply aware of my responsibilities to them – and to our many other stakeholders – in being asked to lead this wonderful company.In line with our strategy, we continued to move the portfolio in the	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1250: In line with our strategy, we continued to move the portfolio in thedirection of the faster-growing segments of the market, especially those that speak to consumers’ growing desire for more natural products and purpose-driven brands. The vast majority of businesses we have acquired over recent years are now growing by double digits on a yearly basis and we were delighted at the end of last year to announce the acquisition of GlaxoSmithKline's Health Food Drinks portfolio, including its iconic Horlicks brand in India and the rest of Asia, further increasing our presence in the highly attractive health-food category. We also completed successfully the complex disposal of the spreads business, returning the after-tax proceeds to shareholders.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1251: I especially want to thank my predecessor, Paul Polman. Unilever has been transformed under his inspiring leadership. He has worked tirelessly to make the company stronger and the world a better place.

PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1257: ENVIRONMENT UNDER PRESSURE According to a 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, the world is on course for warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius by as early as 2030. Drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions are threatened if no action is taken to curb emissions. The cost of inaction will be profound, estimated to be about $44 trillion in lost GDP. But the rewards for positive action are substantial and thanks to the Paris Agreement, nearly 200 countries are pursuing carbon reforms. This is helping to open about $23 trillion in opportunities for climate-smart investments in 21 emerging markets alone by 2030.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1258: MARKET OVERVIEW The top 25 global FMCG players generate sales of over €700 billion in markets characterised by their dynamic nature. A global, digital economy is fuelling rapid change characterised by fragmentation throughout the value chain. This requires fast, innovative, profitable global and local responses in areas such as supply chain, customer development, marketing and brand innovation.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1259: Climate change also threatens our food system which must produce 50% more food to feed over 9 billion people by 2050. However, changing weather patterns and growing seasons threaten suitable cultivation areas around the world. Business can spur positive change and achieving food security could create 80 million jobs and business opportunities worth $2.3 trillion annually by 2030. Linked to climate change is water scarcity, a threat to 3.2 billion people. If current usage continues the world will have only 60% of its required water by 2030. See pages 30 and 33 to 35 for more on climate change risks.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1260: In response, Unilever has reorganised into three Divisions: Beauty & Personal Care, Foods & Refreshment and Home Care. Each has implemented our C4G change programme which was introduced in 2016 to create a simpler organisation capable of innovating more quickly to evolve our brand portfolios and meet changing trends more effectively – harnessing our global scale and local expertise. Acquisitions of new brands have further supplemented our core portfolios.The use and threat of tariffs for political leverage continues to drive uncertainty in our markets. Currency volatility in Argentina, Turkey and Pakistan as well as major political disruption in markets such as Brazil, continues to demand rapid local responses from our brands.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1261: Other environmental concerns are growing in significance, such as plastic packaging. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation found that 95% of the value of plastic packaging is lost to the economy after one short use, equivalent of $80-120 billion lost to the global economy each year. See pages 14 to 15 and 30 for more on plastic packaging risks and opportunities.Our business is shaped by systemic macro forces. We periodically review these to ensure our strategy remains relevant. We believe there are four distinct but overlapping macro trends that will shape the world over the next ten years.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1262: PEOPLE LIVING DIFFERENTLY Concerns about the planet and society are matched by concerns about our own health and what we eat. Growing urbanisation is shaping new health priorities while the cost of care is also rising, placing health services under increased pressure. Obesity kills more people than hunger, while many populations struggle to find sufficient nourishment in their diets. Sugar is seen as a major threat which has resulted in a number of countries choosing to implement a tax on it. For food companies, this presents a mix of challenges and opportunities. Meanwhile, public awareness around mental health issues continues to grow, particularly with digital connectivity.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1263: DIGITAL AND TECHNOLOGY REVOLUTION Business is evolving at a faster pace than ever. Traditional understanding and engagement with consumers is being redefined. Digital technology is transforming relationships with consumers – from connectivity and the Internet of Things, to robotics, artificial intelligence and augmented reality. All are linked by more targeted and data-driven marketing.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1264: Fragmentation remains a principal driver of change, impacting consumer journeys, route-to-market channels and media, and brand spend. Consumers are taking different paths to purchase, often combining offline and online channels where influencers are a growing force. Younger consumers continue to prioritise meaning over materialism and are demanding more authenticity, transparency and natural ingredients. The talkability of brands is vital in a fragmented digital media landscape, favouring those with a strong point of view, or purpose, relevant to consumers. The growth of the global workforce and middle class consumers, especially in emerging markets, has resulted in long-term shifts favouring greater convenience and time-saving attributes.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1265: Consumers are now living in communities that are becoming more diverse with fragmented identities. Younger generations, especially Millennials and Generation Z, continue to have a powerful influence on cultural norms – on issues such as diversity and discrimination. Meanwhile, older generations are exerting a strong economic influence. The number of people aged 80 or over is expected to triple by 2050.Migration is having a profound effect on national identity. One in 30 people are international migrants living abroad, a 40% rise since 2000. People are encouraged to move, in part, by the rise of global megacities with more than ten million inhabitants. The number of these will rise from 31 to 41 by 2030. Such urbanisation is expected to create an additional 500 million one-person households between 2016 and 2030. Climate change looks set to increase migration even further as populations are displaced due to rising sea levels and changing climates.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1266: Channels to reach consumers are equally fragmented. There is less reliance on ‘big box’ retailers with e-commerce growing 13% globally, driven by direct-to-consumer models and platforms such as Amazon and Alibaba. The market is also polarising between specialist channels and discounters and convenience stores, creating both risks and opportunities for FMCG companies.The proliferation of digital and social media channels has resulted in media fragmentation, with digital advertising now about 40% of the market. However, improving standards and tackling fraud to protect the integrity of digital marketing are major challenges.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1267: The #MeToo movement has encapsulated a major shift in women’s rights. The global gender gap in primary school completion and enrolment in secondary school has closed, however barriers and opportunities remain, particularly on equal pay. According to the World Bank, gender equality would enrich the global economy by an estimated $160 trillion if women were earning as much as men in the workplace. Men themselves face changing roles. Time spent with children has almost quadrupled for men since 1965 and in some countries the burden of care is changing in response to improved paternity leave entitlements and shared parental leave. Changing demographics and societal expectations present significant risks and opportunities for FMCG companies.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1268: POLARISED WORLD Slow and uneven economic growth, rising inequality, political polarisation and the rise of nationalism within countries is impacting consumer confidence. At the same time, consumers continue to have low confidence in government, business, media and NGOs, according to the Edelman Trust Barometer. However, according to the same study, three out of four people agree a company can take action to both increase profits while improving economic and social conditions in the community it operates in.Find out more about how we are responding to the trends outlined in this section in delivering value for our stakeholders (pages 11 to 18).8Strategic ReportUnilever Annual Report and Accounts 2018DELIVERING LONG-TERM VALUE FOR OUR STAKEHOLDERS	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1269: DELIVERING LONG-TERM VALUE FOR OUR STAKEHOLDERSOUR CONSUMERS Our three Divisions meet the constantly changing needs of consumers by harnessing our global scale and local expertise. Innovation is the fuel, creating great products that consumers love, from nutritionally balanced foods and refreshments, to affordable soaps that combat disease, luxurious shampoos and everyday household care products. Whatever the brand, wherever it is bought, we’re working to ensure that it plays a part in helping fulfil our purpose as a business – making sustainable living commonplace.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1270: sustainable products. In October we joined calls from consumers, NGOs and politicians for a worldwide ban on animal testing of cosmetics and Dove, the Division’s biggest brand, achieved PETA accreditation as ‘cruelty free’. The PETA cruelty-free logo will start appearing on many packs in 2019 and more brands are set to follow. We are also developing new packaging solutions with less plastic, better plastic and no plastic. REN launched a sea kelp and magnesium body wash in a bottle made from 100% recycled plastic, with 20% from recovered ocean plastic. Simple launched biodegradable face wipes made from renewable plant fibres and sustainable wood pulp. More packaging innovations will be launched in 2019.BEAUTY & PERSONAL CARE BEAUTY & PERSONAL CARE (BPC) GENERATED TURNOVER OF €20.6 BILLION, ACCOUNTING FOR 40% OF UNILEVER’S TURNOVER AND 33% OF OPERATING PROFIT IN 2018.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1271: Overall, underlying sales growth was 3.1%, driven by skin care and skin cleansing, but partly offset by slower growth in deodorants and oral care due to market and competitive pressures. Profitability progressed with underlying operating margin improving 80 basis points to 21.9%. Geographically, a number of countries grew above the market including US, Canada and the UK while emerging markets such as Pakistan and Bangladesh also had high growth. Brazil underperformed as did Japan and parts of Western Europe, where markets were flat to declining. In our channels, e-commerce remains a key driver of growth alongside the Health & Beauty channel where we would like to see faster growth following a slow year, especially in North America.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1272: The Division is our largest and includes five global brands with turnover of €1 billion or above, namely Axe, Dove, Lux, Rexona and Sunsilk, as well as other household names such as TRESemmé, Signal, Lifebuoy and Vaseline. BPC has leading global positions in hair care, skin cleansing and deodorants, and strong local positions in skin care and oral care. The prestige business leads in premiumising our portfolio with turnover of €490 million from brands including Dermalogica and Hourglass.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1273: BPC’s strategic ambition is to become the most valuable and admired BPC company, led by its purpose ‘Beauty that cares for people, society and our planet’. Its priorities are to continue to grow its core brands, build a future-fit portfolio, lead in high-growth spaces and adopt a new model of marketing. The priorities reflect and respond to key trends shaping the Division. 2018 saw increasing fragmentation across route to market, retail channels and media, alongside growing data, analytic and automation capabilities. Together these trends are creating a more dynamic, complex and sophisticated landscape with greater segmentation, differentiation and personalisation.Looking ahead, we will continue to build our future-fit portfolio while adopting the new model of marketing, to deliver strong growth, making an accretive contribution to Unilever’s top and bottom line.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1274: FOODS & REFRESHMENT FOODS & REFRESHMENT (F&R) GENERATED TURNOVER OF €20.2 BILLION, ACCOUNTING FOR 40% OF UNILEVER’S TURNOVER AND 58% OF OPERATING PROFIT IN 2018.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1275: The Division launched in January 2018 after the previous Foods and Refreshment Categories merged. The integration and relocation of the global teams to Rotterdam is complete. The disposal of the spreads business was also completed in July. F&R now includes the foods, ice cream and beverages categories, as well as Unilever Food Solutions, our dedicated foodservice business. F&R is home to five global brands with turnover of €1 billion or above, namely Knorr, Hellmann’s, Magnum, Lipton and Heart brand (eg Wall’s) as well as other famous global brands including Brooke Bond and Ben & Jerry’s. It also includes local jewels such as Bango and Robertson's plus recent B Corp acquisitions such as Pukka Herbs, Sir Kensington’s and Mãe Terra. F&R's ambition is to accelerate growth while improving underlying operating margin. F&R’s purpose 'Taste good, Feel good, Force for good' underpins our strategic priorities which are to: transform the portfolio; organise for agility and lower costs; and	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1276: priorities which are to: transform the portfolio; organise for agility and lower costs; and transform capabilities.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1277: BPC’s core brands are introducing new innovations and formats quickly and at scale, such as the new shower mousses from Axe, Dove and Radox as well as a growing range of products which respond to the trend for natural and wellbeing products. During 2018 we launched Vaseline Clinical Care and Dove Derma Series in the fast-growing therapeutics segment and Dove Facial Cleansing Series infused with 100% plant-derived botanical oils in Japan. Hair care has created and launched multiple naturals products, creating a business with over €300 million in turnover in 2018.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1278: Succeeding in the hyper-fragmented world demands greater consumer responsiveness and we are proud to have launched nine new brands over the past two years: ApotheCARE Essentials, Hijab Fresh, K-Bright, K-JU, Korea Glow, Love Beauty and Planet, Pure Derm, Purifi and Skinsei. Love Beauty and Planet has expanded from North America into four markets in Europe and is now active across several categories including skin cleansing, deodorants, skin care and hair care.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1279: Our efforts to transform the F&R portfolio are driven by consumer insights. For example, we are seeing stronger preference for healthier products with more natural and organic ingredients. F&R has launched a number of products addressing this trend, including Magnum and Hellmann’s vegan variants in Europe, meat-free Knorr launches in the Nordics and Ben & Jerry’s non-dairy alternatives. Knorr also expanded its organic and 100% natural ranges in Europe. In our beverages category, we continue to grow our ‘good for me tea’ ranges. Lipton’s range, which includes variants such as detox and stress-less, continued its global roll-out with strong performance. Recently acquired brands such as Pukka Herbs are being rolled out at pace. However, given continuous acceleration of the external landscape, we have to step up portfolio transformation further and increase the speed of our response to trends.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1280: Our acquisitions play a key role in building the future-fit portfolio. In the last four years, BPC has acquired 13 companies including wellbeing focused Equilibra in 2018. AHC (Carver Korea), acquired in 2017, showed strong e-commerce performance and in 2018, we rolled it out to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Russia. Schmidt’s Naturals, also acquired in 2017, has extended beyond deodorants into more categories. The acquisition of Quala S.A completed in February 2018. Within two months of acquisition, its Savile and Ego extensions had brought to market multiple new products in five categories. Strong progress has been made building a highly attractive prestige portfolio which is on track to becoming a €1 billion business. Our most recent acquisition in prestige, Hourglass, is growing fast, expanding into new geographies and with a commitment to become entirely vegan by 2020.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1281: Our market-focused organisation and agility supports our portfolio transformation and delivered several new brands in 2018 such as RED RED (UK), Culture Republick (US), and Jawara (Indonesia). We announced an agreement to acquire Horlicks and other consumer healthcare nutrition products in India and other Asian markets from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), and also acquired the Vegetarian Butcher (Netherlands) and three ice cream brands – Adityaa (India), Betty (Romania) and Denny (Bulgaria). After success in the US, Breyers Delights was launched in Europe. In addition, we introduced innovative licensed ice cream brands including Kinder in Europe and Cornetto Oreo in India.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1282: Future growth will depend on accelerating the adoption of a new model of marketing focused on brands with purpose, generating great content, delivered via digital channels using advanced data and analytics. The model is creating many new consumer touchpoints. For instance, Axe collaborated with DJ Martin Garrix to launch his Burn Out video with over 40 million YouTube views to date, celebrating the brand's message of individuality. In Latin America, Sunsilk partnered with an online influencer to co-create products for curly hair.Our purpose-led brands are well positioned to meet growing concerns about the fragility of the planet and consumer preference for more11Strategic ReportUnilever Annual Report and Accounts 2018DELIVERING LONG-TERM VALUE FOR OUR STAKEHOLDERS CONTINUED	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1283: DELIVERING LONG-TERM VALUE FOR OUR STAKEHOLDERS CONTINUEDConsumers’ shopping habits continue to change. We launched the IceCreamNow platform in partnership with restaurant delivery services, building a new home-delivery channel. We have also launched a global front-of-house programme to showcase our teas and condiments in restaurants, hotels and bars, and to capitalise on the growth of eating out and out-of-home consumption. These represent significant business opportunities.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1284: growth opportunities. The Division responded to these changes by creating four consumer-centric categories: Fabric solutions which focuses on ready to wear clothes (eg Omo, Surf, Radiant); Fabric sensations which focuses on fabrics, fashion and lifestyle (eg Comfort, Snuggle); Home & hygiene (eg Sunlight, Sun) which focuses on delivering care for a cleaner world; and life essentials which unites our air and water purification brands (eg Pureit, Truliva, Blueair). Home Care’s purpose 'Making your home a better world. Making our world a better home' underpins the Division’s strategic priorities: strengthening further the foundation of the business; making Home Care fit for the future; and investing in capabilities.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1285: The second F&R strategic priority is to organise for agility and lower costs. In 2018, our 5S and ZBB programmes stepped up fuelling our gross margin and marketing support. We will continue our savings programme to reduce structural costs, while providing funding for portfolio transformation and margin expansion. Our speed to market has improved by almost a third, reflecting how C4G is helping to unlock speed and agility. We are also piloting new ways of working across our teams.Home Care strengthened the foundations of the business by delivering superior products and benefits. We launched Cif Specialist sprays across 15 countries in Europe whilst continuing to roll-out our toilet blocks to 11 more markets. We expanded our product portfolio into high potential geographies, building on our most established brands such as Omo-branded floor cleaners in Brazil. Our Comfort Intense ultra-concentrated fabric conditioners are now in 20 markets and continue to enjoy strong growth.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1286: Our final strategic priority is to transform our capabilities with a focus on R&D, lean innovation and precision marketing. The creation of our state-of-the art global Foods Innovation Centre in Wageningen (Netherlands) will further strengthen our innovation capability. It is scheduled to open in 2019. We are also enhancing our capabilities in digital-driven marketing through extra resourcing across key markets, upskilling our current teams and hiring digital savvy marketeers.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1287: Our brands made progress in embracing purpose to connect more meaningfully with consumers – in particular millennials. In India, Domex enrolled renowned movie stars in its 'Pick up the brush' campaign to help overcome the social stigma associated with cleaning toilets, a key barrier to improve sanitation. Seventh Generation, acquired in 2016, stepped up its advocacy for Climate Justice together with the Sierra Club to move cities to commit to 100% renewable energy. Home Care’s biggest brand, Omo/Persil, joined forces with National Geographic, IKEA and Lego to promote the developmental benefits of play in children.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1288: These strategic priorities are underpinned by the development of more purpose-led brands. Knorr, Hellmann’s, Lipton, Brooke Bond and Ben & Jerry’s continued to grow, each fuelled by a unique purpose which is resonating with consumers. Brooke Bond for example continued its work tackling cultural taboos through its campaigns, addressing same-sex relationships in Canada and divorce in the Gulf markets. Meanwhile, Hellmann’s launched a major focus on food waste with an activation in Brazil to inspire people to use Hellmann’s to transform leftovers into tasty meals. Action on plastic packaging is another priority for F&R. We have partnered with Ioniqa and Indorama Ventures to pioneer a technology which converts PET waste into virgin grade material for use in food packaging. In the UK, PG tips started to introduce 100% biodegradable plant-based pyramid bags. More innovations and new technologies are in the pipeline.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1289: The second pillar of our strategy is to future-proof our business to lead new trends. We intensified our efforts and increased our footprint in the fast-growing natural segment through the launch of Omo naturals in New Zealand, France and Brazil among others, the roll-out of Seventh Generation in more markets and the launch of Sunlight Naturals across South-East Asia and South Africa. Our brands such as Cif, Omo/Persil and Seventh Generation responded to growing concerns about plastic by including recycled plastic in their packaging. Home Care launched Day2, a dry wash spray that revives clothes between washes – saving time and water. Our ultra-concentrated laundry gems, a new format launched in the UK in 2017, performed below expectations. In South Africa we reacted quickly to the drought in Cape Town with Domestos Flush Less, a toilet spray that disinfects and eliminates odours without the need to flush. We increased our presence in e-commerce, crossing €500 million of sales and	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1290: the need to flush. We increased our presence in e-commerce, crossing €500 million of sales and continued to experiment with new business models such as peer-to-peer laundry services.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1291: During 2018 F&R turnover declined 9.9% to €20.2 billion, due to the sale of spreads and currency devaluation. Underlying sales growth was 2.0% while our underlying operating margin improved by 80 basis points to reach 17.5%. Europe returned good results in ice cream, underpinned by good weather and innovations such as Magnum pints and Kinder ice cream. However, developed markets overall remain difficult and are seeing slower volume growth due to increasing segmentation of consumer preferences, especially in foods, where our efforts on portfolio transformation were not enough to offset the headwinds. Traditional channels in Europe such as supermarkets and hypermarkets continue to discount, creating deflationary pressure. Latin America had a challenging year due to tough economic conditions, a truckers’ strike in Brazil and currency headwinds in Argentina which affected growth in these two markets. Excluding Latin America, emerging markets generally delivered a strong performance.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1292: two markets. Excluding Latin America, emerging markets generally delivered a strong performance. Several key markets including India, China and Turkey saw double- digit growth reflecting the strong potential in emerging markets.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1293: The third strategic pillar is investing in our capabilities. This includes partnering to tap into the opportunities that data brings to make Home Care more efficient and better able to seize growth opportunities. In China, our water purification brand, Truliva, partnered with Alibaba to develop an online leasing market for water purifiers. We also joined forces with Ms Paris, the Chinese dress rental platform, that allows consumers to hire designer dresses and return without laundering. To support our R&D efforts, we have inaugurated the Materials Innovation Factory at the University of Liverpool, a world-class centre of excellence in advanced material chemistry and an ecosystem that brings together innovation partners and leading academics to develop more sustainable and superior formula and packaging for our brands.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1294: F&R will continue to drive growth and margin by focusing on its strategic priorities. Our portfolio transformation, step-up in capabilities and shift in culture are of paramount importance to meet these objectives.Home Care delivered underlying sales growth of 4.2% while our underlying operating margin improved by 80 basis points to reach 13.0%. Key drivers of growth were North and South Asia with South East Asia, Middle-East, Turkey and the US also performing strongly. By contrast, our performance in Latin America was challenged by a trucker’s strike and extreme inflationary pressures. Our home & hygiene and fabric sensations categories delivered strong, broad-based profitable growth whereas life essentials performed below expectations largely driven by a significant decline in category growth in air purification in China and intense competitive pressures. Margin expansion in fabric solutions was hampered by inflationary headwinds and competitive pressures on pricing.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1295: HOME CARE HOME CARE GENERATED TURNOVER OF €10.1 BILLION, ACCOUNTING FOR 20% OF UNILEVER’S TURNOVER AND 9% OF OPERATING PROFIT IN 2018.Home Care is home to two global brands with turnover of €1 billion or above, namely Dirt is Good (eg Omo and Persil) and Surf. Other leading brands include Comfort, Domestos, Sunlight, Cif, Seventh Generation as well as our air and water purification brands Blueair, Pureit and Truliva/ Qinyuan. 79.5% of our turnover is in developing and emerging countries. Home Care’s ambition is to deliver sustained underlying sales growth and step up underlying operating margin.Home Care will continue to drive growth and margin by shifting our portfolio and footprint towards the higher growth, more profitable market segments, formats, channels and geographies while continuing to address with agility changing consumer preferences.

By the end of 2018, we had reached 653 million people, making a significant contribution to the Sustainable Development Goal on Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG6).SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT OUR MULTI-STAKEHOLDER MODEL AIMS TO REWARD OUR SHAREHOLDERS WHILE POSITIVELY IMPACTING SOCIETY.

Pdf_Chunk_id1297: Our impact on society starts with our 155,000 employees who received €5.3 billion in pay in 2018, and extends across our value chain including the millions of retailers and distributors who sell our products in more than 190 countries, generating income and employment for many more. Our suppliers also benefit from the €34 billion we spent on goods and services in 2018. The taxes we pay are another important contribution to society. Total tax borne by Unilever in 2018 was €3.7 billion, of which €2.3 billion was corporation tax. Unilever fully complies with the tax laws in the countries where we operate. Where tax law is unclear, or has not kept pace with modern business practice, we interpret our obligations in a responsible way, guided by our Tax Principles.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1298: In order to increase the reach and social impact of some of our biggest health & hygiene programmes we continue to explore the potential of using mass media and digital to drive behaviour change at greater scale, as well as scaling up partnerships to increase the reach of more conventional on-ground programmes. Dove, one of Unilever’s biggest brands which grew at 7.8% in 2018, has reached around 35 million young people since 2004 through its Self-Esteem Project. To expand its reach, Dove has partnered with the Cartoon Network to create Steven Universe mini episodes which bring to life the proven themes from our on-ground programmes to boost self-esteem for young people. Our aim is that this will reach 20 million young people over the next two years. This series is supported by a music video which has so far received over 1.8 million views on YouTube. As well as reaching more young people with body confidence messaging, this activity is helping to raise overall awareness of Dove’s work	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id1300: UNILEVER SUSTAINABLE LIVING PLAN Our impact on society is significant but we want our impact to go beyond business as usual, delivering value for multiple stakeholders at the same time as growing our business. This idea is encapsulated in the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP) which represents a simple idea – that business growth and sustainability are not mutually exclusive. By focusing on sustainable growth, we believe we will generate consistent and profitable long-term shareholder returns. The USLP has three big goals: improving the health and well-being of more than one billion people by 2020; halving our environmental footprint by 2030; and enhancing livelihoods for millions by 2020. These goals are supported by over 50 time-bound stretching targets and a transformational change agenda which aims to create change on a systemic scale.

Pdf_Chunk_id1302: Since 2010, Lifebuoy's programmes have reached 458 million people through schools, health clinics and community outreach. Lifebuoy has recently expanded its behaviour change programme on the importance of handwashing with soap using mobile technology. The new service aims to reach out to women in media dark areas, providing free advice to mothers on their child’s health. Another recent Lifebuoy partnership with Gavi (the Vaccine Alliance) ties together the importance of handwashing with soap and immunisation, using a variety of channels including home visits and mobile communications. While our programmes have focused on reaching children and mothers on- ground, we have long believed that TV advertising can drive behaviour change. To test this, we ran a study in India to assess the effectiveness of specific Lifebuoy TV adverts. The study showed a significant increase in the frequency of handwashing with soap after people watched the adverts. We are progressing with peer review	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id1304: Our actions on sustainability are creating value in numerous ways, generating more growth, lower costs, less risk and more trust in the business. Our Sustainable Living brands, which combine a powerful purpose with products contributing to the USLP, are a key driver of growth. In 2017, 26 of our top 40 brands were Sustainable Living brands including Ben & Jerry’s, Dove and Lifebuoy. Our Sustainable Living brands grew 46% faster than our other brands and accounted for 70% of total growth. Product innovations which respond to water scarcity and climate change at the same time as helping consumers, continue to create growth opportunities for us. Recent sustainability innovations which deliver consumer benefits include our new Love Beauty and Planet range in the US which uses fast-rinse technology in its conditioners thereby requiring less water. Domestos Flush Less, available in water-scarce South Africa, keeps toilets clean while saving nine litres of water per flush.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1305: For more than a decade, we have been working to make our products even healthier by increasing goodness and reducing nutrients of concern like sugar, salt and saturated fat. We aim to double the proportion of our portfolio that meets the highest nutritional standards, based on globally recognised dietary guidelines. So far 48% of our products have reached this standard and we are on track to meet our 2020 commitment. We are also using the power of our brands to empower people to make responsible choices. In support of our Code Policy on Responsible Marketing, in 2018 95% of our Foods and Refreshment portfolio had full nutrition labelling on pack that aligned with Unilever’s product labelling criteria (based on 96% of global sales from 1 April 2018 to 30 June 2018). We continued our efforts to improve the goodness in our products and set out the ambition to provide 200 billion servings by 2022 containing at least one of the 5 key micronutrients: iron, iodine, zinc, vitamin A or D. We	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id1307: The USLP strengthens our business by helping us to save costs. Since our baseline year of 2008 we have saved over €600 million on energy costs in our factories; and by using fewer materials and producing less waste we have avoided costs of approximately €234 million.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1308: Through the USLP, we are also responding directly to a number of macro forces (see page 8) that are both risks and opportunities in our markets – such as a lack of access to water and sanitation, strains on the food system, climate, the environment, and rising inequality. We have identified the broad issue of sustainability, related to the achievement of our goals in the USLP, as a principal risk (page 29) as well as a number of specific risks including climate change (page 30) and plastic packaging (page 30). Mitigating the physical impacts of climate change is critical because we depend on raw materials sourced from countries that are particularly vulnerable to rising sea temperatures and changing weather patterns. See pages 33 to 35 for our response to the risks and opportunities from a low-carbon economy.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1309: REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT Our activities impact the environment, principally through the use of water, energy and land as well as the production of waste and greenhouse gas emissions, largely as a result of consumer use. These impacts are reflected in the USLP environmental pillar and are supported by our Environmental Policy which is available on our website. Our environmental big goal is by 2030 to halve the environmental footprint of the making and use of our products as we grow our business. This is a challenging target requiring action across our value chain on waste, water and greenhouse gas emissions – in turn contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1310: As a consumer goods company, we are acutely aware of the causes and consequences of the linear 'take-make-dispose' model of consumption. We are taking action across our value chain to reduce, reuse, recycle and recover post-consumer waste and move towards a more circular model. Our manufacturing operations have seen a reduction in total waste disposed to landfill, or incineration without energy recovery, of around 97% per tonne of production since 2008.Trust is essential for any business, but it must be earned. The USLP is a key driver of trust among our employees and potential recruits. We are the number one FMCG graduate employer of choice in around 50 countries where we recruit. We have been ranked first in the annual GlobeScan survey of sustainability leaders for eight years and also came top of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index Personal Products sector in 2018.13Strategic ReportUnilever Annual Report and Accounts 2018	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1311: 13Strategic ReportUnilever Annual Report and Accounts 2018DELIVERING LONG-TERM VALUE FOR OUR STAKEHOLDERS CONTINUEDFurthermore, we achieved zero non-hazardous waste to landfill across our global factory network in 2015 and have maintained this every year since. We are more than half way towards meeting our 2020 commitment to reduce waste associated with the disposal of our products. This has reduced by about 31% since 2010 due to increases in consumer recycling and changes in our portfolio.ENHANCING LIVELIHOODS Our activities have the potential to positively impact the livelihoods of not only our employees, but the millions of people who are involved in our value chain – notably smallholder farmers and small-scale retailers. By 2020, we aim to enhance the livelihoods of millions of people as we grow our business. In 2018, we made steady progress across the three pillars of our Enhancing Livelihoods goal.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1312: In 2017, we made a further commitment on waste, ensuring that all our plastic packaging will be fully reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. We are moving in the right direction to make all of our packaging recyclable but there is more work to do. Find out more on page 15. Seventh Generation is eliminating virgin petroleum plastic (new plastic made from oil) and virgin fibre (virgin wood pulp) from its packs and has committed that all its packaging will be fully recyclable or compostable by 2020. In Brazil, Omo is launching its first plant-based detergent in a 100% recyclable pack containing recycled plastic.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1313: We believe that women's empowerment is the single greatest enabler of development and economic growth. We are building a gender- balanced organisation (page 16) while improving women’s safety in the communities in which we operate, and developing employment opportunities through the Shakti programme which has provided work for around 113,000 women, equipping them to sell Unilever products in low income rural communities. Shakti continues to scale up in India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Nigeria and is now being rolled out to new countries, including Colombia. By 2018, we had also enabled about 1,724,000 women to access initiatives aiming to develop their skills.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1314: We have reduced the water used in manufacturing by 44% per tonne of production since 2008. Our biggest water impact occurs when consumers shower, bathe and clean clothes with our products. In 2018, our water impact per consumer use reduced by around 2% compared to 2010. We recognise that we are a long way short of halving our water impact and we will not achieve this very challenging target by the end of 2020. This is due in part to our portfolio being made up of more products that have a higher than average water footprint than in 2010 and the significant consumer behaviour change needed to reduce water consumption when our products are used, where the vast majority of our water footprint resides. Going forward we want to broaden our water strategy by recognising the role of water in our consumers’ lives and its importance as a growth driver for our business. We are developing and launching innovative products which deliver the benefits people need with less water, or even no water	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1315: innovative products which deliver the benefits people need with less water, or even no water at all, as well as products that improve the quality of water.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1316: As well as directly creating wealth and jobs, our business supports millions of people who source, make and sell our products – we call this inclusive business. By 2018, we had enabled 746,000 smallholder farmers and over 1.7 million small-scale retailers to access initiatives to improve agricultural practices or increase incomes. The Philippines Kabisig programme, for example, has reached over 165,000 small retailers, training them in stock control, financial management, sales and customer service – increasing the earning potential of small-scale retailers at the same time as growing turnover for Unilever.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1317: Our Responsible Sourcing Policy (RSP) is at the heart of our ambition to source 100% of procurement spend responsibly and through suppliers that meet our RSP requirements. In 2018, we focused on completing the onboarding of high risk suppliers into our compliance database and programme. Over 20,000 suppliers have now completed their registration and are undergoing review processes allowing us to verify their compliance to the RSP and identify areas for remediation. In 2018, 61% of procurement spend was through suppliers who were assessed as meeting the mandatory requirements of the RSP.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1318: As with water, our biggest greenhouse gas impact comes through consumer use. The greenhouse gas impact of our products across their lifecycle has increased by about 6% since 2010. We are having more success in areas that are within our direct control such as manufacturing where we have cut CO2 from energy by 52% per tonne of production compared to 2008. Similarly, we continue to make savings through the ongoing roll-out of freezer cabinets that use more climate-friendly natural (hydrocarbon) refrigerants. Our ability to meet our target partly depends on changes in the energy markets worldwide, such as the rate of installation of renewable electricity in many countries. We have a role to play as an industry leader to help shape those markets. We are committed to implementing the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (see pages 33 to 35). Two of our carbon reduction targets have been officially approved by the Science-Based Targets Initiative.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1319: We continued to embed human rights with a focus on our eight salient issues (ie those at risk of the most severe negative impact through Unilever’s activities or business relationships). We also began a process to review these through a series of global and regional consultations. This year, one of our primary areas of focus has been on the eradication of forced labour in our supply chain through training, capacity building and driving a robust vetting process for temporary labour agencies. We launched and are rolling out our Land Rights Principles and Implementation Guidance. Human rights risks are included as part of our sustainability and ethical principal risks (see pages 29 and 33). See our website and our latest Human Rights report for more on our activities and due diligence processes.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1320: Our sustainable sourcing strategy focuses on a set of key agricultural crops, which are not only crucial to our brands, but also where we can drive measurable impact for sustainable transformation of the industry. By the end of 2018, the total volume of our agricultural raw materials that were sustainably sourced was 56%. In line with our strategy, sustainably sourced volumes for our 12 key crops increased by over 4% including significant increases for palm oil and tea, whilst our sustainably sourced volumes for non-key crops reduced. As a result, our performance versus 2017 was flat. The sale of our spreads business during 2018 had a slight downward impact on overall sustainable sourcing performance given the substantial volume of sustainable palm oil used by our spreads business.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1321: Safety is a critically important part of our USLP. Our Vision Zero strategy continues to aim for: Zero Fatalities; Zero Injuries; Zero Motor Vehicle Accidents; Zero Process Incidents; and Zero Tolerance of Unsafe Behaviour and Practices. This is supported by our Code Policy on Occupational Health & Safety. Our Total Recordable Frequency Rate from 1 October 2017 to 30 September 2018 went from 0.89 accidents per 1 million hours worked in 2017 to 0.69, thanks to a continuous focus in high risk areas. See page 47 for more on safety.DRIVING TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE Our USLP is a bold ambition to achieve change within our company. However, we are just one company among many and the problems our society faces are urgent, large and complex. Our 'transformational change' agenda combines direct action on the SDGs with partnerships and external advocacy to create change on a systemic scale – while unlocking business opportunities at the same time.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1322: A number of key activities moved our sustainable sourcing agenda forward in 2018. We deepened our commitment to transparency with the publication of our palm oil mill list and the creation of a grievance tracker for our palm oil supply; and we, along with key NGOs including WWF, initiated a new jurisdictional approach to palm oil in Malaysia. The additional programmes were also supported by digital solutions like leveraging satellite data for deforestation detection and risk assessments, mapping of smallholder parcels in Indonesia, sending critical weather alerts to farmers' mobiles in India, and using the Internet of Things to optimise tea production in Kenya. We are also piloting innovative approaches to achieving upstream traceability in several supply chains.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1323: We are working on a number of areas where we believe we can make the biggest difference: climate change and forests; sustainable agriculture, land use and food security; health and well-being including water, sanitation and hygiene; and improving livelihoods and creating more opportunities for women. Many of these issues relate directly to the SDGs. We are stepping up our engagement with governments, NGOs and others in our industry on these issues. We are also developing a range of partnerships that will accelerate and scale new solutions.14Strategic ReportUnilever Annual Report and Accounts 2018DELIVERING LONG-TERM VALUE FOR OUR STAKEHOLDERS CONTINUED	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1324: DELIVERING LONG-TERM VALUE FOR OUR STAKEHOLDERS CONTINUEDimportance of focusing on speed and responsiveness to the market. We use survey results to help us take action in areas where there is room for improvement. For example, last year we implemented the new Standards of Leadership in response to feedback we received. Alongside our UniVoice survey, we use Glassdoor to benchmark our employee experience. As at 31 December 2018, our rating of 3.9 out of 5 was above the site average of 3.2.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1325: OUR PEOPLE UNILEVER EMPLOYEES ARE EMPOWERED TO ACT LIKE BUSINESS OWNERS IN A PURPOSEFUL CULTURE. The world of work is rapidly changing. Automation, flexible resourcing and new business models continue to impact our business and workforce. The workforce expects more flexibility and is increasingly freelance. A job for life is no longer the norm. Once employed, people must regularly reinvent themselves with new skills. The digital transformation of work and growth of automation is bringing both great benefits, but also great disruption. The composition of the workforce is changing too. By 2020, Millennials will make up around 35% of the global workforce. Just over half of Unilever's own workforce in 2018 were Millennials.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1326: DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION We want our culture to be inclusive, promoting gender balance and respecting the contribution of all employees regardless of gender, age, race, disability or sexual orientation – as set out in our Code Policy on Respect, Dignity and Fair Treatment.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1327: The USLP sets out clear targets for expanding opportunities and enhancing access to skills and training for women in our value chain. It also sets out our ambition to build a gender-balanced workforce within Unilever, with 50% of women in management positions by 2020. By the end of 2018, 49% of total management were women (47% in 2017). Among the top 92 executives, 23% were women (22% in 2017). If you include employees who are statutory directors of the corporate entities whose financial information is included in the Group’s 2018 consolidated accounts in this Annual Report and Accounts, the number increases to 474 (71%) males and 190 (29%) females. 38% (5 out of 13) of the Board were female (38% in 2017). Of our total workforce of 154,848, 101,383 (65%) were male and 53,465 (35%) were female at the end of 2018.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1328: CREATING A FUTURE-FIT WORKFORCE In response to the trends outlined above, we are taking action across our business, including simplifying processes and ways of working to free people from non-value adding tasks so they can focus on key priorities. 2018 saw the continued implementation of Connected 4 Growth (C4G), our organisational change programme, and the creation of three new Divisions to bring further focus and simplicity. Our regular surveys show that 74% of our people now feel more empowered to make decisions. Our time to bring innovations to market is now 40-50% faster than in 2016.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1329: With the advance of AI and robotics, it is more important than ever that we strike the right balance between the use of technology and more human-centred approaches. We have invested in Una Hub, an AI-based platform, which automates responses to all general employee enquiries so People Experience Leads and HR Business Partners can focus on more complex queries, and provide face-to-face support where relevant.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1330: We run programmes across Unilever aimed at attracting, retaining and developing female talent. This includes developing candidates for potential future roles, aiming for 'balanced slates' so that we interview equal numbers of men and women for roles, and practical help such as a minimum 16 weeks paid maternity leave as a global standard – more than the regulatory requirement in over 50% of countries where we operate. In 2018, we also committed to introduce by the end of 2019, three weeks of fully paid paternity leave as a benefit to all new fathers, adopting partners and parents in same-sex couples.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1331: Our research shows that a focus on purpose helps attract talent and binds us together for growth. Through our People with Purpose programme, more than 30,000 employees have joined workshops to help them define their purpose, with 50,000 targeted by 2019. Our global Univoice survey results reinforce the importance of these workshops – 92% of employees who believe they can live their purpose at Unilever, also say that their job inspires them to go the extra mile.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1332: Unilever has a commitment to gender equality and fairness in the workplace based on equal pay for equal work and achieving greater gender balance. Pay and overall reward is intended to be gender neutral, with any differences between employees in similar jobs reflecting performance and skill. Gender pay gaps develop where there is a representational imbalance between genders. When we look at our worldwide business as a whole, in countries with more than 250 employees, the average female pay was 26% higher than male pay in 2018 (2017: 25%). This is largely due to the fact that 80% of our lower paying blue-collar roles are held by male employees. ‘Equal pay for equal work’ is our primary ambition and is a crucial part of fair compensation. Our Framework for Fair Compensation reviews the average pay differences between genders at each work level and in each country. The most recent analysis highlights that there is more work to do to continue improving our gender balance, and related	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1333: highlights that there is more work to do to continue improving our gender balance, and related gender pay gaps, at various levels and in various countries throughout the business.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1334: As the workplace changes it is important that we continue to prioritise mental wellbeing. In 2018, we officially recognised World Mental Health Day in October and continue to invest in the mental wellbeing of our people, alongside their physical wellbeing. This builds on the roll-out of a mental wellbeing framework globally several years ago which guides us in tackling the health risks across our business.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1335: Another area of focus is on personalising training and capability building to develop the right leaders and teams who are fit for the future. We are responding to demands for new skills through continuous learning. Since the launch of Degreed, our online learning platform in 2017, 76,000 people have access to 2.3 million pieces of learning content, with 55,000 pieces being consumed on a monthly basis, including PowerUp, our digital upskilling programme. We are also accelerating impact through new agile ways of working. In the UK and US we are piloting more agile team structures to ensure we have the right people, doing the right job at the right time, while breaking down silos.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1336: BUSINESS INTEGRITY Our principles and values apply to all our employees through our Code and Code Policies. Our employees undertake mandatory annual training on these Policies via online training modules and an annual business integrity pledge. Our Business Integrity guidelines include clear processes for managing Code breaches. For more information on Business Integrity see our website.RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION Our attractiveness as an employer is improving amongst Millennial and Generation Z recruits. We are the number one FMCG graduate employer of choice in around 50 countries and the most followed FMCG employer on LinkedIn with over 4 million followers as at the end of 2018.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1337: In 2018 1,206 whistleblowing incidents were opened (defined as Code Policy cases raised). We closed 1,252 incidents across all areas of our Code and Code Policies, with 662 confirmed breaches. In 2018, we terminated the employment of 330 people. Business integrity risks are included as part of our ethical and legal and regulatory principal risks (see page 30). The Code and Code Policies reflect our desire to fight corruption in all its forms. We are committed to eradicating any practices or behaviours though our zero-tolerance policy.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1338: In 2018 we introduced more ways to give our employees a voice, through monthly pulse surveys and global and local surveys on a range of topics, reaching around 70,000 people. Our largest listening exercise is the annual engagement survey called UniVoice which covered a representative sample of almost 25,000 office-based employees in 2018. We maintained high levels of employee engagement – 90% of employees said they were proud to work for Unilever and our Engagement Index remained at 74%. The survey also reinforced theOur Responsible Sourcing Policy and Responsible Business Partner Policy help to give us visibility of our third parties to ensure their business principles are consistent with our own.16Strategic ReportUnilever Annual Report and Accounts 2018OUR PARTNERS WE WORK WITH MANY PARTNERS TO SUPPORT THE SUSTAINABLE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS.

PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1340: ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS We have many interactions with our stakeholders on a daily basis. Our Code of Business Principles and Code Policies guide how we interact with suppliers, customers, governments, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and trade associations in particular. Only authorised and appropriately trained employees or representatives can engage with these groups and we require that a record should be kept of all interactions and that all engagement must be conducted: in a transparent manner with honesty, integrity and openness; in compliance with laws and in accordance with Unilever’s values. Our website contains further disclosure on how we engage with our stakeholders.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1341: We continue to engage with small-scale retailers by professionalising their store operations through capability training. Our Rise Sales Academy is currently being piloted in Nigeria and Sri Lanka to deliver store operations retail training for micro retailers across the world. In turn, this will help contribute to our USLP target to improve the incomes of 5 million small-scale retailers in our distribution network.GOVERNMENTS We co-operate and engage with governments, regulators and legislators, both directly and through trade associations, in the development of proposed legislation and regulation which may affect our business interests. All employees involved in political engagement must comply with our Code of Business Principles and Code Policies. We do not support or fund political parties or candidates or any groups that promote party interests.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1342: SUPPLIERS Our supply chain is very diverse and highly dynamic as we respond to changing consumer preferences, in line with our C4G programme. Our suppliers help us meet consumer needs by innovating, creating capacity and delivering quality materials and services for our products. We work with a large range of suppliers in over 160 countries – from multinational companies through to SMEs and smallholder farmers.Our participation in policy discussions is varied, covering macro topics such as climate change, nutrition and plastic packaging. We engage with government stakeholders directly or through membership of representative organisations, including trade associations.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1343: We screen suppliers in relation to their supply chain capabilities and the level of associated environmental and social risk. Managing supplier risk is a key role of our Supply Chain function. All suppliers must complete our registration process to assess compliance with the mandatory requirements of our Responsible Sourcing Policy which includes anti-bribery and corruption. We conduct audits and follow up issues identified where necessary.TRADE ASSOCIATIONS We are members of and support a number of trade associations and similar organisations which help us to advance our public policy interests. We keep a record of our trade association memberships and membership fees, which is regularly updated. We also engage with peer companies, both individually and in coalitions, on issues of mutual interest. This includes working together to implement sustainable business strategies and drive change.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1344: Partner to Win is our approach to building long-term relationships with selected key strategic supplier partners in order to achieve mutual growth. It focuses on five key areas: quality and service, innovation, value, sustainability and capacity and capability. Partner to Win helps us strengthen supplier and customer collaboration and improves operational efficiency. In 2018, we had 175 Partner to Win suppliers, representing 35% of total procurement spend.These associations reflect our global scale and presence across several product categories. We list our global memberships in the Engaging with stakeholders section on our website. We are registered in the Transparency Register of the European Union. Our US trade association memberships can be found on the FAQ section of the Unilever USA website.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1345: We came first in the annual Gartner Supply Chain Top 25 for the third year running, emphasising our leading practices in the area of supply chain management, in particular on sustainability and digitalisation.NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS We are building transformational partnerships in collaboration with NGOs who share our vision for a more sustainable future. These partnerships are instrumental in improving the quality of people’s lives, driving growth, achieving our USLP targets and contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals.CUSTOMERS In a fragmented channel landscape, those companies that best serve their shoppers and customers with bespoke solutions will benefit most. Unilever serves consumers through ten different channels: hyper and supermarkets, e-commerce, out of home, drug stores, small stores, discounters, Food Solutions, Unilever International, prestige channel and global retail.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1346: In collaboration with NGOs, we build programmes on the ground to implement our brands’ purpose in addition to advancing our efforts in areas such as sustainable sourcing and distribution – often in partnership with governments and other businesses. We drive scale through new business models, digital technologies and external financing.We serve around 26 million retail stores globally of which we cover eight million directly and another 18 million indirectly through wholesale and cash & carry.Our leadership engages with stakeholders through platforms such as the World Economic Forum, UN Global Compact, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the Consumer Goods Forum, championing a more inclusive model of capitalism and the pursuit of long-term value creation for the benefit of multiple stakeholders. Partnerships with NGOs are crucial to deliver the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (see page 15).	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1347: In 2018 we focused on developing our e-commerce channels, digitising our value chain to respond to the rapid fragmentation of traditional routes to market. We are actively driving B2C and B2B e-commerce in our top 30 markets. Our focus is to build a balanced e-commerce business model, growing across e-retailers, bricks and mortar online sales and direct-to-consumer businesses. In 2018 we signed a logistics partnership with JD.com, China's largest retailer. JD will help to bring our most popular products to the most hard-to-reach communities in China, securely and quickly.Health & Beauty channels have been an area of focus for Beauty & Personal Care. In Europe we have been increasing our presence and share with the discounter channel, which continues to see growth, contributing to top line growth for Unilever while delivering incremental gross profit.17Strategic ReportUnilever Annual Report and Accounts 2018DELIVERING LONG-TERM VALUE FOR OUR STAKEHOLDERS CONTINUED	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1348: DELIVERING LONG-TERM VALUE FOR OUR STAKEHOLDERS CONTINUEDBUSINESS TRANSFORMATION Our brand portfolio continues to evolve to match our Divisions' strategic priorities, resulting in the sale of assets that no longer fit our growth model or the acquisition of assets that take us into new market segments and build new market positions. This active portfolio management means that in the past nine years we have sold €6.8 billion of turnover, mainly in the lower growth foods businesses. During that same period, we have acquired approximately €5.3 billion of turnover. The spreads disposals in July allow Foods & Refreshment to focus on growth.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1349: OUR SHAREHOLDERS WE DELIVERED SOLID PERFORMANCE IN 2018 AND REMAIN ON TRACK FOR OUR 2020 TARGETS. We aim to build long-term relationships with our shareholders through positive engagement for the benefit of all our stakeholders. We engage directly with our shareholders on a broad range of financial and environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters. During 2018 we engaged with shareholders on a number of topics including our Remuneration Policy and on the simplification of Unilever. See page 39 and our website for more details. In addition to direct engagement we regularly engage indirectly via ESG ratings organisations such as MSCI, Sustainalytics and ISS, as well as investor-focused sustainability rankings such CDP and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1350: Actively managing our brand portfolio through acquisitions and disposals remains an important strategic growth driver. In December we announced an agreement to acquire the Health Food Drinks portfolio of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in India, Bangladesh and 20 other predominantly Asian markets. Further details of the transaction can be found on our website. The acquisition includes iconic brands such as Horlicks and Boost, and a product portfolio supported by strong nutritional claims. The transaction is aligned with our strategy to increase our presence in health-food categories and in high-growth emerging markets. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory and shareholder approvals, with expected completion around 12 months from the announcement.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1351: PERFORMANCE IN 2018 Underlying sales growth for 2018 was 2.9% and underlying operating margin was 18.4%, a rise of 90 basis points. Turnover declined by 5.1% due to the sale of spreads and currency devaluation; operating margin was 24.6% due to profit on the spreads disposals.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1352: Emerging markets saw a good performance in underlying sales growth of 4.6% including improved price growth in response to commodity inflation. Notable improvements were in India, which was strong across all categories, and China where strong volume growth was seen particularly in e-commerce. Argentina was classified as hyper-inflationary and price growth was excluded from underlying figures from July; any volume growth or decline is included within underlying figures. North America saw an improvement in underlying sales growth and there was acceleration in the US, helped by our acquisition programme in recent years, particularly in BPC. Europe remains challenged by a deflationary environment generally. We delivered solid volume-driven growth across our business with good margin progression.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1353: In October we completed the acquisition of a 75% stake in the Italian personal care business Equilibra which has a growing presence in the natural skin and hair care segments. We also completed the acquisition of Quala’s Beauty & Personal Care and Home Care brands. We acquired a number of exciting new businesses including the Vegetarian Butcher (Netherlands) which expands our portfolio into plant-based foods, and three ice cream brands – Adityaa (India), Betty (Romania) and Denny (Bulgaria). With the exception of brands launched in countries where they were not previously sold, acquisitions and disposals only contribute to underlying sales growth from 12 months after completion.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1354: A key part of our 2020 programme is faster portfolio evolution in order to focus Unilever on more rapidly growing segments. This process continued at pace during 2018 with the focus on new brand launches and evolving our core brands. Our C4G organisation means we can respond to consumer trends more quickly. We have launched nearly 30 brands in the last two years. Local brands are also being launched more quickly followed by rapid global roll-out, for instance Breyers Delights, Love Beauty and Planet and Lakme all responding to the trend for more natural and healthy products.

Pdf_Chunk_id1355: We generated €5.0 billion of free cash flow and 18.8% return on capital. Underlying earnings per share was €2.36, a rise of 5.2%, and dividends were increased 8%, reflecting Unilever’s confidence in future profit growth and cash generation. Diluted earnings per share was €3.48. Our share price has fallen 0.42% for PLC shareholders and risen 0.98% for NV shareholders. For information on our non-GAAP measure, see pages 23 to 26.PROGRESS AGAINST OUR 2020 FINANCIAL TARGETS In April 2017, we set out financial targets for 2020 to further accelerate shareholder value. In 2018 we maintained a strong delivery of savings with over €2 billion of savings from the supply chain, ZBB and change programmes. As a result, we are on track to meet our cumulative savings target of €6 billion by 2019 and a 2020 underlying operating margin target of 20%, compared to 16.4% in 2016.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1356: Evolving our core brands has also accelerated. Brands such as Dove, Lifebuoy and Sunsilk in Beauty & Personal Care all launched new variants responding to consumer trends. In Home Care there were new launches of Domestos, Cif and Comfort while Foods & Refreshment extended the Knorr, Hellmann’s and Lipton brands with new on-trend variants (for more information on brand launches see pages 11 to 12).We continue to maintain our leverage by targeting a Net Debt to underlying EBITDA ratio of 2x, consistent with a credit rating of at least A/A2. During 2018, we returned €6 billion to shareholders through our share buyback programme following the sale of spreads.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1357: Realising the opportunities from digital technology to help deliver further growth and margin improvement is another key part of our business transformation. We have launched a digital transformation programme across all aspects of our value chain. We have 30 platforms across Unilever which power our business using digital technologies. Our Enterprise & Technology Solutions team is set up to deliver a technologically enabled Unilever for the future while ensuring that processes and activities are shared and scaled across the business. This will allow us to use technology as a competitive advantage rather than a cost.During the year the Boards decided to withdraw proposals to revise Unilever’s dual-headed legal structure after extensive engagement with shareholders. We remain firmly committed to our 2020 improvement programme and are confident of meeting its key goals. To simplify our capital structure, we cancelled the NV preference shares in February 2019 (see page 38).	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1358: Digital technology changed our approach to marketing some time ago but the transformation of Unilever more broadly has begun at pace. AI, machine learning and voice related technologies are being used to deliver personalised and immersive experiences to our consumer platforms such as Recipedia and Cleanipedia websites. We are also driving digital through our R&D organisation, introducing new tools to increase the speed, efficiency and quality of our innovation processes.18Strategic ReportUnilever Annual Report and Accounts 2018FINANCIAL REVIEWFINANCIAL OVERVIEW 2018	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1359: CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT Turnover declined by 5.1% to €51.0 billion including an unfavourable currency impact of 6.7% (2017: 2.1% unfavourable currency impact) mainly due to weakening of currencies in key emerging markets such as Brazil, Argentina and India. Underlying sales growth^ was 2.9% (2017: 3.1%), with a positive contribution from all divisions. Underlying volume growth was 1.9% (2017: 0.8%) and underlying price growth was 0.9% (2017: 2.3%). The net impact of acquisitions and disposals was a reduction in turnover of 1.0% (2017: 0.9% increase) with the impact of recent acquisitions such as Carver Korea and Quala outweighed by the disposal of the spreads businesses. Emerging markets contributed 58% of total turnover (2017: 58%) with underlying sales growth of 4.6% (2017: 5.9%) coming from price growth of 1.7% and volume growth of 2.8%. Developed markets underlying sales growth was 0.5% coming from volume growth of 0.7% slightly offset by price decline of 0.2%.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1360: Underlying operating margin improved by 0.9 percentage points to 18.4%. Gross margin improved by 0.5 percentage points driven by margin- accretive innovations and continued strong delivery from our ‘5-S’ savings programmes. As a percentage of turnover, overheads and brand and marketing investment were down by 0.3 percentage points and 0.1 percentage points respectively as a result of productivity gains from zero-based budgeting.Operating profit was up 41.5% to €12.5 billion (2017: €8.9 billion) as a result of €3,176 million from non-underlying items. Non-underlying items within operating profit comprised a gain on spreads disposal of €4,331 million, a credit from the early settlement of contingent consideration related to the Blueair acquisition of €277 million, partially offset by restructuring costs of €914 million, acquisition and disposal related costs of €201 million and impairment and one-off items of €317 million.Highlights for the year ended 31 December2018	PDF

The cost of financing net borrowings was €57 million higher than 2017. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in net debt which was partially offset by lower interest rates and a prior year one-off in Brazil relating to the interest element of an indirect tax amnesty programme. The average interest rate on net debt reduced to 2.2% from 2.7% in 2017. The pensions financing charge was €25 million, down from €96 million in 2017 reflecting a lower pension deficit at the beginning of 2018.A monetary gain of €122 million was recorded following adoption of IAS 29 ‘Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies’ in Argentina (see note 1) from 1 July 2018.

Pdf_Chunk_id1363: The effective tax rate was 21.1% compared with 20.8% in the prior year. In both years the rate was low relative to longer term norms, due to the significant impact on tax of the disposals of our spreads businesses in 2018 and US tax reform in 2017.Net profit from joint ventures and associates was up 19% at €185 million, with the increase coming mainly from a gain on disposal of the spreads business of the Portuguese joint venture. Other income from non-current investments was €22 million versus €18 million in the prior year.Diluted earnings per share were up 62.0% at €3.48. The increase was mainly driven by the €4,331 million gain on disposal for the spreads businesses, improvement in operating margin and the impact of the share buyback programmes.	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id1378: UNDERLYING SALES GROWTH Underlying Sales Growth (USG) refers to the increase in turnover for the period, excluding any change in turnover resulting from acquisitions, disposals and changes in currency. We believe this measure provides valuable additional information on the underlying sales performance of the business and is a key measure used internally. The impact of acquisitions and disposals is excluded from USG for a period of 12 calendar months from the applicable closing date. Turnover from acquired brands that are launched in countries where they were not previously sold is included in USG as such turnover is more attributable to our existing sales and distribution network than the acquisition itself. Also excluded is the impact of price growth from countries where the impact of consumer price inflation (CPI) rates has escalated to extreme levels.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1379: NON-GAAP MEASURES Certain discussions and analyses set out in this Annual Report and Accounts (and the Additional Information for US Listing Purposes) include measures which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) such as IFRS. We believe this information, along with comparable GAAP measurements, is useful to investors because it provides a basis for measuring our operating performance, and our ability to retire debt and invest in new business opportunities. Our management uses these financial measures, along with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our operating performance and value creation. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP. Wherever appropriate and practical, we provide reconciliations to relevant GAAP measures.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1380: There are two countries where we have determined extreme levels of CPI exist. The first is Venezuela where in Q4 2017 inflation rates exceeded 1,000% and management considered that the situation would persist for some time. Consequently, price growth in Venezuela has been excluded from USG since Q4 2017. The second is Argentina, which from Q3 2018 has been accounted for in accordance with IAS 29, and thus from Q3 2018 Argentina price growth is excluded from USG. The adjustment made at Group level as a result of these two exclusions was a reduction in price growth of 32.4% for the year. This treatment for both countries will be kept under regular review.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1381: EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES Unilever uses ‘constant rate’ and ‘underlying’ measures primarily for internal performance analysis and targeting purposes. We present certain items, percentages and movements, using constant exchange rates, which exclude the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We calculate constant currency values by translating both the current and the prior period local currency amounts using the prior period average exchange rates into euro, except for countries where the impact of consumer price inflation rates has escalated to extreme levels. In these countries, the local currency amounts before the application of IAS 29 are translated into euros using the period closing exchange rate.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1382: Prior to Q3 2018 USG only excluded the impact of price changes in countries where consumer price inflation has escalated to extreme levels of 1,000% or more. However, given the need to account for our Argentinian business in accordance with IAS 29, we have now also excluded price changes in countries that need to be accounted for in accordance with IAS 29. Prior to Q3 2018 there were no countries that were accounted for under IAS 29, so no restatements are necessary.23Strategic ReportUnilever Annual Report and Accounts 2018FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUEDThe reconciliation of USG to changes in the GAAP measure turnover is as follows: TOTAL GROUP	PDF

This measure reflects the underlying earnings for each share unit of the Group.(b) For 2018 underlying price growth in Venezuela (from January 2018) andArgentina (from July 2018) has been excluded from underlying sales growth and an equal and opposite adjustment made in effect of exchange rate.

Pdf_Chunk_id1402: OUR RISK APPETITE AND APPROACH TO RISK MANAGEMENT Risk management is integral to Unilever’s strategy and to the achievement of Unilever’s long-term goals. Our success as an organisation depends on our ability to identify and exploit the opportunities generated by our business and the markets we are in. In doing this we take an embedded approach to risk management which puts risk and opportunity assessment at the core of the Board agenda, which is where we believe it should be.For each of our principal risks we have a risk management framework detailing the controls we have in place and who is responsible for managing both the overall risk and the individual controls mitigating that risk.Unilever’s functional standards define mandatory requirements across a range of specialist areas such as health and safety, accounting and reporting and financial risk management.

Pdf_Chunk_id1406: BOARDS’ ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORKS The Boards, advised by the Committees where appropriate, regularly review the significant risks and decisions that could have a material impact on Unilever. These reviews consider the level of risk that Unilever is prepared to take in pursuit of the business strategy and the effectiveness of the management controls in place to mitigate the risk exposure.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1407: The Boards have established a clear organisational structure with well defined accountabilities for the principal risks that Unilever faces in the short, medium and long term. This organisational structure and distribution of accountabilities and responsibilities ensure that every country in which we operate has specific resources and processes for risk reviews and risk mitigation. This is supported by the Unilever Leadership Executive, which takes active responsibility for focusing on the principal areas of risk to Unilever. The Boards regularly review these risk areas, including consideration of environmental, social and governance matters, and retain responsibility for determining the nature and extent of the significant risks that Unilever is prepared to take to achieve its strategic objectives.

Pdf_Chunk_id1409: FOUNDATION AND PRINCIPLES Unilever’s approach to doing business is framed by our Purpose and values (see page 1). Our Code of Business Principles sets out the standards of behaviour that we expect all employees to adhere to. Day-to-day responsibility for ensuring these principles are applied throughout Unilever rests with senior management across categories, geographies and functions. A network of Business Integrity Officers and Committees supports the activities necessary to communicate the Code, deliver training, maintain processes and procedures (including support lines) to report and respond to alleged breaches, and to capture and communicate learnings.Details of the activities of the Audit Committee in relation to this can be found in the Report of the Audit Committee on pages 43 to 45.

We have therefore decided to get broader understanding on the climate change risks to our agricultural sourcing and extend our analysis to two other important crops to Unilever: Palm Oil and Tea, for which suitable climate change models for yield predictions will be available in 2019.RESPONDING TO RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES Unilever’s vision is to grow our business whilst decoupling our growth from our environmental footprint and increasing positive social impact. This vision explicitly recognises that sustainable growth – including management of climate-related risks and opportunities – is the only way to create long-term value for all our stakeholders.The main impacts of the 2°C scenario were as follows: • Carbon pricing is introduced in key countries and hence there areincreases in both manufacturing costs and the costs of raw materials such as dairy ingredients and the metals used in packaging.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1412: Zero net deforestation requirements are introduced and a shift to sustainable agriculture puts pressure on agricultural production, raising the price of certain raw materials.The Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP) was developed to deliver our vision. It is fully integrated with our business strategy. Climate- related issues are integral to the USLP. Two of our GHG reduction targets included in the USLP are recognised as science-based: • Halve the greenhouse gas impact of our products across the lifecycle by 2030 (this target covers all the phases across the lifecycle of our products: ingredients/raw materials, manufacturing, distribution, retail, packaging, consumer use and disposal) • Reduce scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 100% from our own operations by 2030 (this is part of our ambition to be become carbon positive in our manufacturing by 2030)The main impacts of the 4°C scenario were as follows: • Chronic and acute water stress reduces agricultural productivity	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1413: in some regions, raising prices of raw materials.Increased frequency of extreme weather (storms and floods)causes increased incidence of disruption to our manufacturing and distribution networks.Temperature increase and extreme weather events reduce economic activity, GDP growth and hence sales levels fall.Our analysis shows that, without action, both scenarios present financial risks to Unilever by 2030, predominantly due to increased costs. However, while there are financial risks which would need to be managed, we would not have to materially change our business model. The most significant impacts of both scenarios are on our supply chain where costs of raw materials and packaging rise, due to carbon pricing and rapid shift to sustainable agriculture in a 2°C scenario and due to chronic water stress and extreme weather in a 4°C scenario. The impacts on sales and our own manufacturing operations are relatively small.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1414: We are taking action across our value chain to reduce our emissions, creating growth opportunities and minimising risk. Our commitment to source 100% of our palm oil from sustainable sources is helping to avoid emissions from deforestation (see pages 14 and 47). Our efforts to reduce energy and GHG emissions in manufacturing are helping us to save costs. For example, by using less energy, we have already avoided energy costs in our factories of over €600 million since our baseline year of 2008.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1415: Our divisions are taking action to reduce emissions. In Home Care we are focusing on concentrated liquid laundry detergents such as Persil, Omo and Surf Small & Mighty which help consumers to wash clothes at lower temperatures, reducing GHG by up to 50% per load. We have removed phosphates from all laundry powders worldwide, resulting in lower greenhouse gas emissions of up to 50% per consumer use. Our Foods & Refreshment division has prioritised reducing greenhouse gas emissions from ice cream freezers since 2008. As the world’s largest producer of ice cream, we have committed to accelerating the roll-out of freezer cabinets that use more climate-friendly natural (hydrocarbon) refrigerants. By 2018 our total purchase of these cabinets had increased to around 2.9 million.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1416: The results of this analysis confirm the importance of doing further work to ensure that we understand the critical dependencies of climate change on our business and to ensure we have action plans in place to help mitigate these risks and thus prepare the business for the future environment in which we will operate.During 2018 we developed and piloted an approach to assess the impact of climate change on our key commodities. We selected soy for this pilot based on its importance to Unilever (large purchased volume), it being a high-profile crop in the countries where it is grown and the availability of good historical price data and suitable climate models.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1417: We developed a methodology which combined forecasting future yields and quantifying the impact on commodity prices of soybean oil. Climate change was the only price factor accounted for in the model used to calculate the impact. Other factors which impact price, such as technology and acreage, were excluded. The model considered the direct risks from climate change to the price of soybean oil, such as change in yield and change in supply. Three modelling steps were performed: • Yield estimation: We analysed multiple agriculture and climate models to provide a forecast range of expected yields in key growing regions.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1418: Detailed Lifecycle Analysis has shown that our GHG contribution from animal-based agriculture, including fats and proteins, is relatively low: 7.5% for Foods & Refreshment and 2.5% for total Unilever. While emissions are comparatively low, the business opportunity is significant for natural and plant-based foods and beverages. We have a range of vegan and vegetarian variants such as Hellmann’s vegan mayonnaise, Ben & Jerry’s non-dairy ice creams, Magnum vegan and other options (see pages 11 to 12). We continue to actively promote vegetarian and vegan recipes, notably via our Knorr brand websites.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1419: A number of our targets directly address risks and opportunities related to water scarcity caused by climate change. We estimate that the sale of products which address water scarcity issues could increase in our Home Care and Beauty & Personal Care divisions where a number of products are available which address water scarcity and/ or have a lower GHG in use. For example, our Beauty & Personal Care division is investing in water smart product innovations such as dry shampoo and cleansing conditioner which help consumers use less water while also offering relevant benefits such as reduced colour loss and damage which can arise from frequent washing. Home Care is combining insights in consumer behaviour and water consumption with innovative technology to develop new market opportunities, launching products and formulations that address water scarcity and help our consumers save water. Day2, the world's first dry wash spray is made with only 0.02% of the water in a normal laundry load.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1420: the world's first dry wash spray is made with only 0.02% of the water in a normal laundry load. Sunlight 2-in-1 Handwashing Laundry Powder and Rin (Radiant) detergent bar are also helping to reduce water consumption at point of use in water-stressed countries.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1421: Price relationship: An econometric model was developed, based on an analysis of the soybean oil market and historical trends, to estimate the impact of climate-induced yield changes on future prices. This model considered the importance of co-products eg soybean meal, substitution potential eg with sunflower oil and industrial uses of soybean oil, as well as the impact of yield on price.Impact estimation: Future yields and price impacts were then translated into an estimated financial exposure from climate change for our business, using our forecast procurement volumes.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1422: Our pilot analysis showed that soybean yields may increase over the 2030 and 2050-time horizon and that subsequent lower prices may then lead to small potential reductions in our procurement spend on soy. While the results may indicate a low financial risk to our business, we would need to consider a wider range of risk factors when determining our strategic response. Indirect risks from climate change, such as catastrophic events or external policy response and adaptation could also have an impact but were not included in our modelling. Furthermore, these pilot results are34Strategic ReportUnilever Annual Report and Accounts 2018	PDF

Pureit and Truliva, our water purification businesses, offer products which provide safe drinking water to millions of people with a lower carbon footprint than alternatives. Our detailed lifecycle analysis shows that Pureit’s total carbon footprint is at least 80% lower than boiled or bottled water. Blueair, our indoor air purification business acquired in 2016, removes contaminants from the air, including hazardous sooty particles associated with the combustion of fossil fuels.The GHG data below relates to emissions during the 12-month period from 1 October to 30 September.

Pdf_Chunk_id1425: 726,167793,4721,438,0421,567,32870.4676.77Unilever continues to support a number of policy measures to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy, including the pricing of carbon and removal of fossil fuel subsidies which act as negative carbon prices. We believe that carbon pricing is a fundamental part of the global response to climate change and without it, the world is unlikely to meet its greenhouse gas reduction targets. We have publicly supported calls for carbon pricing and are members of The Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition, hosted by the World Bank. In 2016, we implemented an internal price on carbon as part of the business case appraisal for large capital expenditure projects. The carbon price is also applied to emissions from our manufacturing sites to raise a clean-tech fund. So far, €73 million has been allocated to this fund for energy and water saving projects. In January 2018 the price of carbon was €40 per tonne.	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id1427: 4,368,6263,895,589^ Carbon emission factors are used to convert energy used in our operations to emissions of CO2. Carbon emission factors for fuels are provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).+ For manufacturing we have selected an intensity ratio based on production. This aligns with our long-standing reporting of manufacturing performance. Emissions from the combustion of biogenic fuels (biomass, fuel crops etc) within our operations are reported separately to other Scope 1 and 2 emissions, as recommended by the GHG Protocol, and excluded from our intensity ratio calculation. The data also excludes Scope 3 emissions (including consumer use of our products) which we report as part of our Unilever Sustainable Living Plan.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1428: Our ability to meet our climate-related targets partly depends on changes in the energy markets worldwide, such as the rate of installation of renewable electricity in many countries. We have a role to play as an industry leader to help shape those markets. We are working collaboratively with partners, suppliers and others to achieve our ambition.Carbon emission factors for grid electricity calculated according to the ‘market­ based method’ are supplier-specific emissions factors reflecting contractual arrangements with electricity suppliers. Where supplier-specific emissions factors are not available, carbon emissions factors reflect the country where each operation is located and are provided by the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Pdf_Chunk_id1429: We’ve created a detailed plan to annually assess the feasibility for Unilever to reach our target to halve the greenhouse gas impact of our products across the lifecycle by 2030, taking both external transitions towards a low-carbon economy as well as the latest available data and assumptions about our GHG footprint into account. The basis of this plan is the set of around 2,800 products representative of our global portfolio across all divisions for which we have full value-chain lifecycle analysis results.using an LCA method compliant with the ISO 14040 standard. We measure the consumer use phase using a combination of primary habits data and on pack recommendations of use combined with lifecycle inventory data. We measure a representative sample of products across 14 countries which account for around 60-70% of our annual sales volume.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1430: ‡ We use a combination of external lifecycle inventory databases (secondary data) and supplier specific data (primary data eg for surfactants, perfumes and some of food ingredients) to measure the GHG emissions of purchased ingredients and packaging materials used in the production of our products.We recalculated the footprint of these products using the latest 2030 projections on external transitions to a low-carbon economy (eg International Energy Agency 2030 projection on grid changes to renewable energy), low-carbon transition plans in our operations (eg achieving zero net deforestation by 2020, using 100% renewable energy by 2020) and Innovation Roadmaps (eg redesign for lower embedded carbon emissions, transforming the temperature-controlled supply chain).ж Downstream distribution is calculated using average distances and modes of transport derived from data collected from our distribution network and logistic providers.

The Boards are one-tier boards, the same people are on both Boards and the responsibility of the Directors is collective, taking into account their respective roles as Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors. The majority of the Directors are Non-Executive Directors who essentially have a supervisory role. In the normal course Unilever has two Executive Directors, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO). On 31 December 2018 the current CEO resigned and his successor, Alan Jope, was appointed on 1 January 2019. Alan will be proposed to be appointed as an Executive Director at the 2019 AGMs. Consequently, between 1 January 2019 and the 2019 AGMs in May we have one Executive Director.	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id1446: INDEPENDENCE AND CONFLICTS As the Non-Executive Directors make up the Committees of the Boards, it is important that they can be considered to be independent.

At least once every three years an independent third party facilitates the evaluation. The last external evaluation was performed in 2017. The evaluation consists of individual interviews with the Directors by the Chairman and, when relevant, by the external evaluator. These interviews are complemented by the completion by all Directors of three confidential online evaluation questionnaires on the efficiency and effectiveness of our Boards, CEO and Chairman. The Boards evaluation questionnaire this year focused on a number of key areas including Strategy, Risk/Financial Controls, Board Effectiveness and Information/Knowledge. The Chairman's statement on page 2 describes the key actions agreed by the Boards following the evaluation.	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id1503: Nils Andersen Judith Hartmann45Governance ReportUnilever Annual Report and Accounts 2018SAFETY Sustainable growth is only achieved if Unilever also grows responsibly – by providing safe, high quality products, and protecting employees and the people and communities in which it operates. Safe and high quality products are one of Unilever's principal risks, see page 31.To promote transparency and traceability of palm oil sourcing, in 2018 Unilever was also the first consumer goods company to publish the names of its suppliers and a map of the 1,400 palm oil mills in its extended supply chain on its website. This was accompanied by a more visible grievance mechanism to facilitate the reporting of issues of non-compliance in the supply chain.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1504: Occupational safety continues to be the personal and everyday responsibility of all those working at Unilever. Reducing Unilever’s Total Recordable Frequency Rate (TRFR) is also a target within the USLP. In 2018 TRFR continued to decrease – from 0.89 accidents per 1 million hours worked in 2017 to 0.69 in 2018 (measured 1 October 2017 to 30 September 2018).Another important step was an industry-first partnership with Indonesian government-owned palm oil plantation company PT Perkebunan Nusantara (PTPN). The partnership is designed to support local mills and smallholder farmers to produce palm oil according to the NDPE standards that are key to multi-sector efforts to transform the palm oil industry.

Pdf_Chunk_id1505: In factories, Unilever’s World Class Manufacturing programme hardwires safety into all aspects of the production process – by enabling good design principles, engineering and operating practices to be applied from the start of any project. This focus drove a reduction of 39.5% in process safety incidents in 2018. Capacity building and leadership also improved safety for contractors (those who work on Unilever sites under the direct supervision of their own management), reducing their recordable injuries by half 51% over 2014-2018 (measured by Lost-Time Injuries Frequency Rate, LTIFR).PACKAGING WASTE Packaging waste, particularly post-consumer plastic packaging waste in oceans and waterways, has never been higher on the global agenda than in 2018. Plastic packaging now sits alongside climate change as a major environmental challenge and is identified as a risk for Unilever's business, see page 30.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1506: Unilever has reduced the waste associated with the disposal of its products by 31% since 2010 (measured as impact per consumer use, towards a target of 50%) and is making strong progress in its own operations and product design. However, the challenge for post- consumer waste is in having the right infrastructure in place to ensure materials are collected and processed, while encouraging consumers to segregate and recycle them.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1507: Unilever’s approach to product safety is based on risk identification and mitigation. This approach covers all aspects of the value chain – from development, sourcing, manufacture and transport to consumer use and disposal of the product – and is centred on the application of rigorous standards based on sound science and the principle of Safe by Design and Safe in Execution. Thanks to a strong focus on product quality, a significant improvement was achieved in 2018 with potentially serious marketplace incidents reduced by 40%. Over 2017-2018, potentially serious marketplace incidents originating in manufacturing have been reduced by 88% and those originating in suppliers of raw and packing materials have been halved.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1508: To support its specific, time-bound targets, at the beginning of 2018 Unilever introduced a new three-part framework designed to sharpen thinking on plastic packaging and innovation: i) Less Plastic means using lighter, stronger and better materials which have a lower environmental impact; ii) Better Plastic entails eliminating problematic materials and using recyclable plastics with a minimum 25% recycled content; iii) No Plastic involves using alternative materials, new packaging formats and alternative models of consumption such as vending – to help reduce use of single-use plastics through innovation, behaviour change and new business models.

Pdf_Chunk_id1510: In 2018 Unilever continued to embed human rights with a focus on its eight salient issues (ie those at risk of the most severe negative impact through Unilever’s activities or business relationships). These are set out in Unilever’s Human Rights Report 2017, with an update on further progress at the end of 2018.

Pdf_Chunk_id1512: PALM OIL Palm oil is one of Unilever’s most significant raw materials and Unilever is one of the world’s major buyers of palm oil. Alongside sustainability and supply chain, Unilever has identified climate change as one of its principal risks (see page [29]) and is committed to eliminating the deforestation associated with unsustainable palm oil production. Securing supplies of sustainable palm oil is therefore a critical element in Unilever’s business and climate strategy and represents a significant target in the USLP.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1513: The Committee was briefed on plans for driving transformational change in the palm oil sector. Unilever’s Sustainable Palm Oil Sourcing Policy has a focus on the implementation of No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation of people or communities (NDPE) commitments by 2020. However, implementation and enforcement remain challenging. To support the transformation of the sector and the implementation of its Policy, Unilever is investing in multiple initiatives. One example is the &Green Fund which is designed to kick-start investments in deforestation- free agriculture in countries that are working to reduce deforestation and peat degradation. Unilever was announced as the first investor. The Fund aims to protect over 5 million hectares of forest and peatlands by 2020, by de-risking private capital investments into large-scale deforestation-free production, protection and inclusion initiatives.

Pdf_Chunk_id1516: DIVERSITY POLICY Unilever has long understood the importance of diversity within our workforce because of the wide range of consumers we connect with globally. This goes right through our organisation, starting with the Boards. Unilever’s Board Diversity Policy, which is reviewed by the Committee each year, is reflected on our website at www.unilever.com/boardsofunilever. The Boards feel that, while gender and ethnicity are an important part of diversity, Unilever Directors will continue to be selected on the basis of their wide- ranging experience, backgrounds, skills, knowledge and insight.In 2018 the Committee also reviewed and considered relevant recommendations on diversity and remains pleased that 45% of our Non-Executive Directors are women and that there are nine nationalities represented on the Boards.

Pdf_Chunk_id1519: In addition, the Committee retains the additional safeguard outlined in the 2017 DRR: if the result of combined annual bonus and MCIP performance outcomes exceeds 75% of the maximum total opportunity (excluding the effects of share price change and dividends on share awards) the Committee will review rigorously the quality and sustainability of underlying performance and then may apply its discretion to reduce or cap the MCIP performance outcome applicable to the Executive Directors.

Pdf_Chunk_id1528: Paul Polman stepped down as CEO and Executive Director with effect from 31 December 2018, and will retire from employment with Unilever effective 2 July 2019 (the “Retirement Date”). Until his Retirement Date he will assist with an orderly transition and handover of responsibilities.In accordance with his service agreement and our Remuneration Policy, Paul Polman: • will continue to receive Fixed Pay and benefits up to the Retirement Date; • remained eligible to receive a discretionary bonus in respect of 2018, determined by the Compensation Committee in the normal way and atthe normal time dependent on the Company’s performance, and paid to him wholly in Unilever N.V. shares (after deduction for tax withholding) which he will be required to hold until the second anniversary of the Retirement Date (see pages 55 to 56 for details);	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1529: will not participate in the MCIP 2019-2022 and will not receive any bonus in respect of the 2019 financial year; • as he is retiring, will be treated as a good leaver and hence his outstanding awards under the MCIP and GSIP long term share incentiveplans will remain capable of vesting in accordance with the rules of the relevant plan. Consequently, it is anticipated that these awards will be pro-rated as follows reflecting Paul Polman’s actual length of service within the vesting period: a) GSIP and MCIP 2016 – 2018 vested on 11 February 2019: 100% (see page 56 for details); b) GSIP 2017 – 2019 vesting around 13 February 2020: 79%; c) MCIP 2017 – 2020 vesting around 17 February 2021: 57%; d) GSIP 2018 – 2020 vesting around 17 February 2021: 46%; and e) MCIP 2018 – 2021 vesting around 16 February 2022: 31%; and will then vest, subject to Company performance, on the respective vesting dates;	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1530: will remain subject to the Company’s minimum shareholding requirements and needs to retain Unilever shares worth at least 5 times hisannual Fixed Pay level until the first anniversary of the Retirement Date and 50% of that amount until the second anniversary of the Retirement Date. Additionally, the Company will continue to pay Paul Polman’s social security obligation in his country of residence on all Unilever source income arising to protect him against the difference between the employee social security obligations in his country of residence versus the UK. The precise cost of this provision will depend on Paul Polman’s total earnings (which will primarily be influenced by the value of his outstanding MCIP and GSIP share awards when they vest) and applicable rates of social security;	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1531: will continue to receive tax return preparation services in respect of total Unilever earnings; • through to the Retirement Date or to the later date as specified below, after which such benefits will cease, will continue to receive:Family Medical Cover to 31 December 2019; and • Death & Disability Insurance Cover.Details of all payments made to and receivable by Paul Polman will be disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report within the Annual Report and Accounts as required going forward.IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REMUNERATION POLICY IN 2019 FOR NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS The current Non-Executive Director fee levels will not be changed for 2019, and we will review fee levels for 2020 during the course of the year.

Pdf_Chunk_id1539: 11.3%16.5%19.2%8.2%10.5%8.3%8.0%4.9%0.2%(a) Calculated using the data from the Executive Directors’ single figure table on page 54 (for information on exchange rates please see the footnotes in that table). (b) The CEO Fixed Pay and other benefits figures reflect the implementation of our new Reward Framework in 2018, including the consolidation of conditionalsupplemental pension accrual into Fixed Pay from the 2018 AGMs, and changes in the relevant sterling:euro exchange rates. The reduction in benefits value is also due to variations in charges for social security and tax return preparation fees, both of which decreased in 2018.(c) The increase in Fixed Pay shown for the CFO reflects the implementation of our new Reward Framework in 2018, including a 5% increase in Fixed Pay with effect from the 2018 AGMs, and changes in the relevant sterling:euro exchange rates. The increase in benefits value is due to an increase in private medical insurance costs.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1540: (d) For the UK and Dutch management population, Fixed Pay numbers have been restated to include cash-related benefits employees receive as part of their total compensation, to ensure we can accurately compare Fixed Pay for the management population against that of the CEO and CFO. Figures are also affected by changes in the average sterling:euro exchange rates for 2017 and 2018, as well as a lower bonus performance ratio in 2018 compared to 2017.EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS (CEO/CFO) PAY RATIO COMPARISON The table below shows how pay for the CEO compares to our UK employees at the 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile.Year25th PercentileMedian Percentile75th PercentileMean Pay RatioYear ending 31 December 2018Salary:£28,804£37,000£50,021Pay and benefits (excluding pension):£34,400£41,443£57,800Pay ratio (Option A):301250179147	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1541: £34,400£41,443£57,800Pay ratio (Option A):301250179147Figures for the CEO are calculated using the data from the Executive Directors’ single figure table on page 54 (where relevant, translated into pounds using the average exchange rate over 2018 (€1 = £0.8835)).Option A was used to calculate the pay and benefits (excluding pension) of the 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile UK employees because the data was readily available for all UK employees of the group and Option A is the most accurate method (as it is based on total full-time equivalent total reward for all UK employees for the relevant financial year). Figures are calculated by reference to 31 December 2018, and the respective salary and pay and benefits (excluding pension) figures for each quartile are set out in the table above. Full-time equivalent figures are calculated on a pro-rated basis.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1542: Annual bonus and long-term incentives (GSIP and MCIP) were not calculated following the statutory method for single-figure pay. Instead, variable pay figures were calculated using: • target annual bonus values multiplied by the actual bonus performance ratio for the respective year (so disregarding personal performancemultipliers, which equal out across the population as a whole);target GSIP values (multiplied by the actual GSIP performance ratio for the respective year, based on closing share prices on the vestingdate); andMCIP values calculated at an appropriate average for the relevant Work Level of employees, ie an average 45% investment of bonus for WL3employees; 60% for WL4-5 employees (with vesting again at actual MCIP performance ratio, based on closing share prices on the vesting date); and for WL6, based on actual variable pay awards and corresponding vesting rates.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1543: The reason for this is it would be unduly onerous to recalculate these figures when, based on a sample, the impact of such recalculation is expected to be limited.We expect to report on trends in these figures and links to wider pay, reward and progression policies in future years in line with relevant reporting requirements.63Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2018Governance ReportTHE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE The Committee’s membership was further refreshed in 2018. Vittorio Colao, Marijn Dekkers and Mary Ma served throughout this period, with Vittorio Colao being appointed Chair on 3 May 2018, upon Ann Fudge’s retirement; Andrea Jung joined the Committee on the same date.The Committee reviewed its terms of reference during the year.

The Committee also carried out an assessment of its own performance in 2018. While overall the Committee members concluded that the Committee is performing effectively, the Committee has agreed to further enhance its effectiveness by monitoring the responsiveness of the Reward Framework to rapidly evolving market conditions and adding a finance briefing session on the continued appropriateness of performance measures for incentive plans.ADVISERS While it is the Committee’s responsibility to exercise independent judgement, the Committee does request advice from management and professional advisers, as appropriate, to ensure that its decisions are fully informed given the internal and external environment.

Pdf_Chunk_id1546: www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com (Code of Conduct: Executive Remuneration Consulting)The Committee is satisfied that the PwC engagement partner and team, which provide remuneration advice to the Committee, do not have connections with Unilever N.V. or Unilever PLC that might impair their independence. The Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that there were appropriate safeguards against such conflicts. The fees paid to PwC in relation to advice provided to the Committee in the year to 31 December 2018 were £146,650. This figure is calculated based on time spent and expenses incurred for the majority of advice provided, but on occasion for specific projects a fixed fee may be agreed.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1547: During the year, the Committee also sought input from the CEO (Paul Polman), the Chief Human Resources Officer (Leena Nair) and the EVP Global Head of Reward (Peter Newhouse) on various subjects including the remuneration of senior management. No individual Executive Director was present when their own remuneration was being determined to ensure a conflict of interest did not arise, although the Committee has separately sought and obtained Executive Directors’ own views when determining the amount and structure of their remuneration before recommending individual packages to the Boards for approval. The Committee also received legal and governance advice from the Chief Legal Officer and Group Secretary (Ritva Sotamaa) and the General Counsel – Executive Remuneration & Employment (Margot Fransen).

Apart from the financial statements of group companies in hyperinflationary economies (see below), the income statement, the cash flow statement and all other movements in assets and liabilities are translated at average rates of exchange as a proxy for the transaction rate, or at the transaction rate itself if more appropriate. Assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates.UNILEVER The two parent companies, NV and PLC, together with their group companies, operate as a single economic entity (the Unilever Group, also referred to as Unilever or the Group). NV and PLC have the same Directors and are linked by a series of agreements, including an Equalisation Agreement, which are designed so that the positions of the shareholders of both companies are as closely as possible the same as if they held shares in a single company.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1568: The financial statements of group companies whose functional currency is the currency of a hyperinflationary economy are adjusted for inflation and then translated into euros. Amounts shown for prior years for comparative purposes are not modified. To determine the existence of hyperinflation, the Group assesses the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the economic environment of the country, such as the cumulative inflation rate over the previous three years.The ordinary share capital of NV and PLC is translated in accordance with the Equalisation Agreement. The difference between the value for PLC and the value by applying the year-end rate of exchange is taken to other reserves (see note 15B on page 106).	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1569: The Equalisation Agreement provides that both companies adopt the same accounting principles. It also requires that dividends and other rights and benefits attaching to each ordinary share of NV, be equal in value to those rights and benefits attaching to each ordinary share of PLC, as if each such unit of capital formed part of the ordinary share capital of one and the same company.The effect of exchange rate changes during the year on net assets of foreign operations is recorded in equity. For this purpose net assets include loans between group companies and any related foreign exchange contracts where settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1570: BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION Due to the operational and contractual arrangements referred to above, NV and PLC form a single reporting entity for the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the financial statements of Unilever are presented by both NV and PLC as their respective consolidated financial statements. Group companies included in the consolidation are those companies controlled by NV or PLC. Control exists when the Group has the power to direct the activities of an entity so as to affect the return on investment.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1571: The Group applies hedge accounting to certain exchange differences arising between the functional currencies of a foreign operation and NV or PLC as appropriate, regardless of whether the net investment is held directly or through an intermediate parent. Differences arising on retranslation of a financial liability designated as a foreign currency net investment hedge are recorded in equity to the extent that the hedge is effective. These differences are reported within profit or loss to the extent that the hedge is ineffective.The net assets and results of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control. The results of disposed businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements up to their date of disposal, being the date control ceases.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1572: Cumulative exchange differences arising since the date of transition to IFRS of 1 January 2004 are reported as a separate component of other reserves. In the event of disposal or part disposal of an interest in a group company either through sale or as a result of a repayment of capital, the cumulative exchange difference is recognised in the income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal of group companies.Intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated.COMPANIES LEGISLATION AND ACCOUNTING STANDARDS The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU), IFRIC Interpretations and in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Civil Code in the Netherlands and the UK Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1592: 9. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUEDIMPAIRMENT CHARGES We have tested all material goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment. No impairments were identified except for the Blueair intangibles. The Blueair acquisition included an element of deferred consideration payable in 2021. The terms relating to this element allowed the sellers to request an early settlement for a reduced sum. Such a request was made in 2018 and the payment was made to the sellers, reducing the consideration payable by €277 million and generating a credit in non-underlying items within the line ‘acquisition & disposal related costs’. This early termination has been considered as a trigger event for an impairment review for Blueair intangible assets and a €208 million charge has been recognised in non-underlying items within the line ‘impairments and other one-off items’ (see note 3)	PDF

The capital structure of the Group is based on management’s judgement of the appropriate balance of key elements in order to meet its strategic and day-to-day needs.

We aim to maintain a competitive balance sheet which we consider to be the equivalent of a credit rating of at least A/A2 in the long term. This provides us with: • appropriate access to the debt and equity markets; • sufficient flexibility for acquisitions; • sufficient resilience against economic and financial uncertainty while ensuring ample liquidity; and • optimal weighted average cost of capital, given the above constraints.Unilever monitors the qualitative and quantitative factors utilised by the rating agencies.

Pdf_Chunk_id1613: 16C. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING CONTINUEDMASTER NETTING OR SIMILAR AGREEMENTS A number of legal entities within our Group enter into derivative transactions under International Swap and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements. In general, under such agreements the amounts owed by each counter-party on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same currency are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other. In certain circumstances, such as when a credit event such as a default occurs, all outstanding transactions under the agreement are terminated, the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable in settlement of all transactions.

Pdf_Chunk_id1614: The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting the positive and negative values in the consolidated balance sheet. This is because the Group does not have any currently legally enforceable right to offset recognised amounts, between various Group and bank affiliates, because the right to offset is enforceable only on the occurrence of future credit events such as a default.The column ‘Related amounts not set off in the balance sheet – Financial instruments’ shows the netting impact of our ISDA agreements, assuming the agreements are respected in the relevant jurisdiction.(I) FINANCIAL ASSETS The following financial assets are subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements.Related amounts not set off in the balance sheet€ million€ million Gross amounts of recognised financial assets set off in the balance sheet€ million€ million€ million€ millionNet amounts of financial assets presented in the balance sheet	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id1619: CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Contingent liabilities are possible obligations that are not probable. They arise in respect of litigation against group companies, investigations by competition, regulatory and fiscal authorities and obligations arising under environmental legislation. In many markets, there is a high degree of complexity involved in the local tax regimes. The majority of contingent liabilities are in respect of fiscal matters in Brazil.Assessing the amount of liabilities that are not probable is highly judgemental. Contingent liabilities are disclosed on the basis of the known maximum exposure. In the case of fiscal matters the known maximum exposure is the amount included on a tax assessment.121Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2018Financial StatementsNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNILEVER GROUP CONTINUED21.

Dividends due to the holders of the preference shares, if any, including any arrears in such dividends, are then paid; if the profit is insufficient for this purpose, the amount available is distributed to them in proportion to the dividend percentages of their shares. Any profit remaining thereafter shall be distributed to the holders of ordinary shares in proportion to the nominal value of their respective holdings of ordinary shares. The General Meeting can only decide to make distributions from reserves on the basis of a proposal by the Board and in compliance with the law and the Equalisation Agreement.31 December32,57715,78120.

Pdf_Chunk_id1666: ACCOUNTING POLICIES The principal accounting policies are as follows:FOREIGN CURRENCY The Company's functional and presentational currency is Pound Sterling. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the Company’s functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the profit and loss account.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1667: A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.TREASURY SHARES Shares held to satisfy options are accounted for in accordance with IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’. All differences between the purchase price of the shares held to satisfy options granted and the proceeds received for the shares, whether on exercise or lapse, are charged to reserves.PROVISIONS Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation exists at the balance sheet date, as a result of a past event, where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated and where the outflow of economic benefit is probable.

Therefore, we do not recognise a liability in any period for dividends that have been proposed but will not be approved until after the balance sheet date. This holds for external dividends as well as intra-group dividends paid to the parent company.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1669: INTANGIBLE ASSETS Finite-life intangible assets mainly comprise licences. These assets are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis in the profit and loss account over the period of their expected useful lives, or the period of legal rights if shorter. None of the amortisation periods exceed 15 years. Indefinite-life intangible assets mainly comprise trademarks and brands. These assets are capitalised at cost but not amortised. They are subject to a review for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate this is necessary. Any impairment is charged to the profit and loss account as it arises.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1670: FINANCIAL GUARANTEES Where the Company enters in financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES Shares in group companies are stated at amortised cost less any amounts written off to reflect impairment.

Pdf_Chunk_id1805: GLOBAL EMPLOYEE SHARE PLANS (SHARES) In November 2014, Unilever’s global employee plan ‘SHARES’ was launched in 17 countries. SHARES gives eligible Unilever employees below senior management level the opportunity to invest between €25 and €200 per month from their net salary in Unilever shares. For every three shares our employees buy (Investment Shares), Unilever will give them one free Matching Share, which will vest if employees hold their Investment Shares for at least three years. The Matching Shares are not subject to any performance conditions. In 2015, SHARES was rolled out globally and is now offered in more than 100 countries. Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in SHARES. As of 21 February 2019, awards for 291,657 NV and 219,423 PLC shares were outstanding under SHARES.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1806: NORTH AMERICAN SHARE PLANS Unilever also maintains share plans for its North American employees that are governed by an umbrella plan referred to as the Unilever North America Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan. These plans are the North American equivalents of the Unilever Share Plan 2017 and the GSIP, MCIP and SHARES plans. The rules governing these share plans are materially the same as the rules governing the Unilever Share Plan 2017, GSIP, MCIP and SHARES plans, respectively. However, the plans contain non-competition and non-solicitation covenants and they are subject to US and Canadian employment and tax laws. The plans are administered by the North America Compensation Committee of Unilever United States Inc. and they are governed by New York law.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1807: The foregoing description of the Unilever North America Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Unilever North America Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan, including all amendments thereto, filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form S-8 (File No. 333-185299) filed with the SEC on 6 December 2012, which is incorporated herein by reference.COMPENSATION COMMITTEE The Committee is concerned with the remuneration of the Executive and Non-Executive Directors and the tier of management directly below the Boards.

NV ordinary shares mainly trade in the form of depositary receipts for shares.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1809: In the United States, NV New York Registry Shares and PLC American Depositary Receipts are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (Deutsche Bank) acts for NV and PLC as issuer, transfer agent and, in respect of the PLC American Depositary Receipts, depositary.At 21 February 2019 (the latest practicable date for inclusion in this report), there were 4,134 registered holders of NV New York Registry Shares and 841 registered holders of PLC American Depositary Receipts in the United States. We estimate that approximately 10% of NV’s ordinary shares (including shares underlying NV New York Registry shares) were held in the United States (approximately 11% in 2017) and approximately 11% of PLC’s ordinary shares (including shares underlying PLC American Depositary Receipts) were held in the United States (approximately 10% in 2017).	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1810: NV and PLC are separate companies with separate stock exchange listings and different shareholders. Shareholders cannot convert or exchange the shares of one for shares of the other and the relative share prices on the various markets can, and do, fluctuate. Each NV ordinary share represents the same underlying economic interest in the Unilever Group as each PLC ordinary share (save for exchange rate fluctuations).	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1811: If you are a shareholder of NV, you have an interest in a Dutch legal entity, your dividends will be paid in euros (converted into US dollars if you have shares registered in the United States) and you may be subject to tax in the Netherlands. If you are a shareholder of PLC, your interest is in a UK legal entity, your dividends will be paid in sterling (converted into US dollars if you have American Depositary Receipts) and you may be subject to UK tax. Nevertheless, the Equalisation Agreement means that as a shareholder of either company you effectively have an interest in the whole of Unilever. On a going concern basis, you have largely equal rights over our combined net profit and capital reserves as shown in the consolidated accounts.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1812: To Unilever’s knowledge, the Unilever Group is not owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by another corporation, any foreign government or by any other legal or natural person, severally or jointly. The Group is not aware of any arrangements the operation of which may at any subsequent date result in a change of control of Unilever.RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Transactions with related parties are conducted in accordance with agreed transfer pricing policies and include sales to joint ventures and associates. Other than those disclosed in Notes 23 to 24 to the consolidated financial statements (and incorporated herein as above), there were no related party transactions that were material to the Group or to the related parties concerned that are required to be reported in 2018 up to 21 February 2019 (the latest practicable date for inclusion in this report).

Pdf_Chunk_id1813: DIVIDEND RECORD The following tables show the dividends declared and dividends paid by NV and PLC for the last five years, expressed in terms of the revised share denominations which became effective from 22 May 2006. Differences between the amounts ultimately received by US holders of NV and PLC shares are the result of changes in exchange rates between the equalisation of the dividends and the date of payment.Following agreement at the 2009 Annual General Meetings (AGMs) and separate meetings of ordinary shareholders, the Equalisation Agreement was modified to facilitate the payment of quarterly dividends from 2010 onwards.20182017201620152014Dividends declared for the yearNV dividendsDividend per €0.16€1.55€1.43€1.28€1.21€1.14Dividend per €0.16 (US Registry)$1.82$1.66$1.42$1.32$1.47PLC dividendsDividend per 31/9p£1.35£1.26€1.09£0.88£0.90Dividend per 31/9p (US Registry)$1.82$1.66$1.42$1.32$1.47	PDF

They are drafted to give a wide scope and provide that the primary objectives are: to carry on business as a holding company, to manage any companies in which it has an interest and to operate and carry into effect the Equalisation Agreement. At the 2010 PLC AGM, the shareholders agreed that the objects clause be removed from PLC’s Articles of Association so that there are no restrictions on its objects.	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id1819: Other than certain economic sanctions which may be in place from time to time, there are currently no UK laws, decrees or regulations restricting the import or export of capital or affecting the remittance of dividends or other payments to holders of the PLC’s shares who are non-residents of the UK. Similarly, other than certain economic sanctions which may be in force from time to time, there are no limitations relating only to non-residents of the UK under English law or the PLC’s Articles of Association on the right to be a holder of, and to vote in respect of, the company’s shares.

Any modification of the NV Articles of Association that prejudices the rights of 7% or 6% cumulative preference shareholders of NV must be approved by three quarters of votes cast (excluding treasury shares) at a meeting of affected holders.Modifications that prejudicially affect the rights and privileges of a class of PLC shareholders require the written consent of three quarters of the affected holders (excluding treasury shares) or a special resolution passed at a general meeting of the class at which at least two persons holding or representing at least one third of the paid-up capital (excluding treasury shares) must be present. Every shareholder is entitled to one vote per share held on a poll and may demand a poll vote. At any adjourned general meeting, present affected class holders may establish a quorum.152	PDF

Pdf_Chunk_id1824: Under the Convention, a United States trust, company or organisation that is operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, educational or public purposes is subject to an initial 15% withholding tax rate. Such an exempt organisation may be entitled to reclaim from tax authorities in the Netherlands a refund of the Dutch dividend tax, if and to the extent that it is exempt from United States Federal Income Tax and it would be exempt from tax in the Netherlands if it were organised and carried on all its activities there. If you are an NV shareholder resident in any country other than the United States or the Netherlands, any exemption from, or reduction or refund of, dividend withholding tax in the Netherlands may be governed by specific provisions in Dutch tax law, the ‘Tax Regulation for the Kingdom of the Netherlands’, or by the tax convention or any other agreement for the avoidance of double taxation, if any, between the Netherlands and your country of residence.

Pdf_Chunk_id1826: UNITED STATES TAXATION ON DIVIDENDS If you are a United States person, the dividend (including the withheld amount) up to the amount of NV earnings and profits for United States Federal Income Tax purposes will be ordinary dividend income. Dividends received by an individual will be taxed at a maximum rate of 15% or 20%, depending on the income level of the individual, provided the individual has held the shares for more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date, that NV is a qualified foreign corporation and that certain other conditions are satisfied. NV is a qualified foreign corporation for this purpose. In addition, an additional tax of 3.8% will apply to dividends and other investment income received by individuals with incomes exceeding certain thresholds. The dividends are not eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to corporations.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1827: any other legal person subject to United States Federal Income Tax with respect to its worldwide income, having no permanent establishment in the Netherlands of which such shares form a part of the business property, these dividends qualify for a reduction of withholding tax on dividends in the Netherlands from 15% to 5%, if the beneficial owner is a company which directly holds at least 10% of the voting power of NV shares.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1828: Where a United States person has a permanent establishment in the Netherlands, which has shares in NV forming part of its business property, dividends it receives on those shares are included in that establishment’s profit. They are subject to income tax or corporation tax in the Netherlands, as appropriate, and tax on dividends in the Netherlands will generally be applied at the full rate of 15% with, as appropriate, the possibility to claim a credit for that tax on dividends in the Netherlands against the income tax or corporation tax in the Netherlands. The net tax suffered may be treated as foreign income tax eligible for credit against shareholders’ United States income taxes.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1829: For US foreign tax credit purposes, the dividend is foreign source income, and withholding tax in the Netherlands is a foreign income tax that is eligible for credit against the shareholder’s United States income taxes.

Pdf_Chunk_id1886: FINANCE AND LIQUIDITY Approximately €1.0 billion (or 31%) of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents were held in the parent and central finance companies, for ensuring maximum flexibility. These companies provide loans to our subsidiaries that are also funded through retained earnings and third party borrowings.

That means an investment-led approach based on delivering our 4G growth strategy – consistent growth, competitive growth, profitable growth and responsible growth, with an equal focus on each. In 2019 we expect market conditions to remain challenging. We anticipate underlying sales growth will be in the lower half of our multi-year 3-5% range, with continued improvement in underlying operating margin and another year of strong free cash flow.

In 2018 we saw higher market inflation than in 2017 with price rises in crude-derived materials including plastic packaging and surfactants. Foreign exchange rates deteriorated over the second half of the year across most emerging markets, with significant impact from Argentina, India, Brazil and Turkey. Looking ahead to 2019 we remain watchful for volatility in commodity and foreign exchange markets.Less cash and cash equivalents held for sale(19)–Current financial assets770599Net debt(20,343)(12,614)	PDF

Some of these operate on an international scale like ourselves, while others have a more regional or local focus. Our business model centres on building brands which consumers know, trust, like and buy in conscious preference to competitors’. Our brands command loyalty and affinity and deliver superior performance.	PDF
Pdf_Chunk_id1900: PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT We have interests in properties in most of the countries where there are Unilever operations. However, none are material in the context of the Group as a whole. The properties are used predominantly to house production and distribution activities and as offices. There is a mixture of leased and owned property throughout the Group. We are not aware of any environmental issues affecting the properties which would have a material impact upon the Group, and there are no material encumbrances on our properties. Any difference between the market value of properties held by the Group and the amount at which they are included in the balance sheet is not significant. We believe our existing facilities are satisfactory for our current business and we currently have no plans to construct new facilities or expand or improve our current facilities in a manner that is material to the Group.
